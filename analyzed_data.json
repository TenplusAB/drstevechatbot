        "answer": "Hi Eva! Yes, it's getting to that time of year, isn't it? I will be doing two free webinars on allergies in the next couple of weeks. Maybe tune in if your dog is struggling in that department.\nIf immunotherapy works, I guess that is great, though it is an expensive thing to try. The last time I looked into it, there was only a 25% chance that it would work very well, so I've never personally recommended it. I'm always looking for treatments with better odds than that.\nAnd, as you said, many dogs can become worse. In that case, you could look at it as a Wind Heat toxin that has deeply penetrated into the system. That ends up creating a Shao Yang disharmony (which is the Chinese diagnosis associated with deeply penetrated pathogens). Thus, a dog worse on immunotherapy would make me wonder about Shao Yang allergy therapies like Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) and even Qing Ying Tang (Natural Path, sold by Kan Essentials as Cool the Blood). Good news, by the way. Gold Standard Herbs will be launching a version of the latter called ImmunoBalm sometime in the next month or so. I think that will help a lot of dogs."

        "answer": "Hi there! From a Chinese perspective, you've tried 'moving' and 'wind expelling' herbs to no avail (which is what all those do in some way shape or form), then the only thing you haven't tried is a pure Tonic. A formula that just strengthens your dog. Sometimes joints are painful because we don't have the muscle power to stabilize them, so I would suggest that next.\nTwo formulas that spring to mind that I would probably use together are made by Kan Essentials: Lift the Qi, and Eucommia & Rehmannia. Introduce them one at a time, and if they are well tolerated, give at least two or three times the label dose to be more sure of an effect. \nAs for the hyoid bone fixation, that's a new one on me. That bone is pretty freely floating, so I'm having trouble imagining the symptoms that you're seeing.\nif those don't work and your pet is miserable, of course you should try some medication. Galliprant is a Blood mover, though, so if you saw nothing at all from those other formulas, Galliprant may not help. Still, no harm in trying if your back is against the wall.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go!"

If it doesn't bother her tummy, give her even five times what the label will suggest. In cancer, dose is very important. The more tumor cells you have, the more herbs you need to get on top of them.\n\nIf the lesion was entirely removed, the formula may prevent recurrence if you use it consistently and she tolerates it well. Consider it just another vitamin to add to her dish. If the lesion is quite big, then using robust amounts (assuming she is fine with the formula) will at least help stymie tumor growth.\n\nThere are many other things you can add to her food to help: Turmeric powder, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), even perhaps one small clove of raw garlic per day (not the whole bulb!). But, after trying many things over the years, Qing Ying Tang (sold by Kan as Cool the Blood) is what I have found works the best.

        "answer": "Samantha Way, we normally ask people not to post about lumps, since they need always be seen by a vet in person. I'm hoping you've been to vet for this, maybe even had a biopsy, and have ruled out tumors etc. If not, that is job #1 - find out what you're dealing with.\n\nAssuming you have done that, and everyone is drawing a blank, I have what I hope will be useful suggestions for getting it to heal, assuming it basically amounts to chronic refractory inflammation.\n\nThe lesion seems to be similar to 'acral lick dermatitis', where some irritant starts a process of chronic inflammation, licking, tissue maceration, more infection, more inflammation, and more licking. Since this is a common problem that regular vets have a hard time solving, I decided to go ahead and answer your 'lump question' even though it's technically against the rules. Hopefully the advice proves useful.\n\nIf we were to strike the words 'chronic inflammation' from the English language and call it something else, then the next best thing would be a disease process marked by a crappy leaky blood supply that allows white blood cells to indiscriminately enter an area, do damage, but not accomplish anything. The cause of that is not whatever is drawing the white blood cells in. The cause of it is the blood vessels.\n\nThis dog, then, likely has a circulatory problem. There's a reason, after all, why lesions that won't heal are often on the distal limbs. The circulation is not great down there at the best of times. Throw in a disease and it often tips the situation over the edge and creates a lesion. \n\nWhy can't conventional medicine solve this issue? Simply put, it has NO treatments to improve circulation to a region in a targeted way. Not despite over thirty years of research. Until someone invents a pill for it, no vet will be talking to you about this. They won't have heard of the problem either (which is called 'endothelial dysfunction'). \n\nDiet is the other reason this kind of issue is rampant. Processed foods promote the vascular issue described above and its attendant secondary inflammation. \n\nOkay, so what can you do? Step one: feed a real food diet, so you lay a foundation for this thing resolving. Good for you if you're already doing that.\n\nStep Two: find a local veterinary acupuncturist and ask them to perform 'circle the dragon' around the lesion. I found a photo on the web that shows what that means: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Ffigure%2FExample-of-surrounding-the-dragon-dry-needling-of-the-scar-in-the-anterior-knee-area_fig1_340309640&psig=AOvVaw1FfwJivdRQTqpgDMekLslw&ust=1748909233460000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCOi5_OW40Y0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE\nBasically it's the random placement of needles around the edge of the lesion (or 'dragon'). One or two of those needles will be near enough to the blood supply to help it recover\n\nStep Three: try some herbs. Chinese medicine didn't know the term chronic inflammation, but they had another phrase (entirely appropriate as it turns out) called Blood stasis. Many herbs that resolve chronic inflammation are classed as Blood movers. You've likely heard of many of them: Curcuma, Boswelia, Mastic. My favourite formula with Blood movers in it for a lesion that is also likely chronically infected and granulomatous is Sublime Joint Formula from Kan Essentials. You can grind up the pills and apply them topically, or just feed them to your dog. Dose liberally, two or three times what the label suggests. \n\nParticularly if your dog is still on a real food diet, use that formula. If they are on real food already, use instead Dispel Stasis from the Palace of Blood. It can also be used topically. To put the ground up tablets in contact with the sore, use an ointment. I'd highly recommend trying to find one made from Echinacea and Calendula. These plants are famous for dealing with 'indurations', which is what old time practitioners called a lump like that.\n\nThose three steps should resolve the issue for you. If you give them a try, let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Tatiana Luces-Riva, I'm not sure what palliative care looks like for a dog, unless they have him in a hospital on an IV hopped up on pain meds. Narcotics like buprenorphine might actually be a good idea, as besides relieving pain, then can slow down the intestines and help give him time to assimilate his food. \n\nAnother drug option that the owners should ask about is steroids. The lack of results in testing tells us that the issue is in the GI lining itself, which presumably there were trying to explain by saying he had something similar to Crohn's disease. Crohn's often responds to steroids. In fact, vets have a saying. \"Nothing should die without first trying steroids\". If they haven't been tried yet and everyone is now giving up and booking euthanasia appointments, then why not see if they can help? It would be silly not to give them a go. The only way they would be a bad idea is if he had an ulcer, but hopefully that has been ruled out with all the imaging studies.\n\nAs for herbs, I can think of half a dozen ideas off the top of my head. It sounds like there is very little wiggle room for trial and error. I sincerely hope they tried to find holistic help locally, as when hours count, that is the best way to make the first decision be the best decision.\n\nOne issue with herbs, though. If he's in a clinic, the staff there may be unwilling to use herbal medicine to help him (although if he is that close to death, then I would hope they would). It's also going to mean likely making your own herbal capsules and likely popping them down his throat, since what I think he needs is not yet sold by any of the major pet natural remedy suppliers. If you're not up for that, then you can stop reading.\n\nOtherwise, of all the many things you could spend precious time trying, the thing I would guess might help the most is a Chinese herbal formula called Wu Mei Wan. It's been in use for 2,000 years to treat severe GI inflammation (even ulceration) causing life threatening emaciation, where the inciting cause is a parasitic infection. The formula is not a dewormer, though. It corrects the defect in the animal (or person) that allowed the parasite to get established in the first place. For a dog to get sick from what I presume was Toxoplasmosis, we know he had to have an underlying vulnerability. Removing the Toxo doesn't remove the weakness, so the next bug that comes along just triggers the same problem.\n\nWMW is not a commonly used formula by veterinarians (or in humans), but not because it doesn't work. More like it's because people don't know about it or understand when to use it. For me, it's my go-to for refractory parasitic issues, even the nasty ones like hookworms. I would suggest trying to find it as the first step to help this guy. If you can't find it, reach back out and I can try to source it for you if the owners, family members and vet staff are 100% on board with giving him another chance. \n\nHopefully there is still time to accomplish something, whether through herbs or drugs. Good luck!"

        "answer": "Mariko Mita, based on what you've shared, Rehmannia Eight from Kan Essentials is indeed a logical place to start. This formula has a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine for addressing kidney-related issues, particularly when protein leakage and hypertension are involved. It works by improving renal blood flow, reducing renal hypertension, and supporting the kidneys' ability to heal. Additionally, Rehmannia Eight can stimulate red blood cell production, which is particularly beneficial if anemia becomes a concern down the line.\n\nGiven Cashmere's UPC ratio of 1.15, which is elevated but not extreme, Rehmannia Eight is well-suited to help manage the protein leakage. I would suggest using it at two to three times the label dose, as the standard dosing is often too conservative for therapeutic effects in cases like this. You can source the Kan Essentials version through Aleksandra Topic, as she provides reliable access to the prescription-strength product designed for animals. Here's the link for reference: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\n\nIn addition to starting Rehmannia Eight, I recommend continuing Cashmere's raw diet, as it supports overall kidney health better than processed foods. There's no need to restrict protein at this stage, as research suggests that normal protein diets do not harm the kidneys when the UPC ratio is below 3. Once you have the results of the follow-up tests, we can reassess and adjust the approach if needed. Let me know how she does with these changes, and we can explore additional options if necessary."

The bone spurs are there to stay  but are usually not painful in themselves. They are more important as an indicator of ligament laxity, which Voltrex usually heals, especially when used with a real food diet. Ensure it is about 1/6 to 1/3 plant food and consider adding probiotics since the microbiome is being shown to play a role in joint health.\nChiropractic issues in the hind end cause luxating patella, which Voltrex can address as well, but people often add in Lumbrex to make the spine more supple and relieve the pain from nerve impingements that makes the animal more vulnerable to luxating patella. The two formulas should work well together to address the current lameness but then help ensure the luxating patella doesn't come back.\nHopefully this advice helps you out!

        "answer": "Mikki Berg, there are some key points in your dog's case that the group at large can benefit from. Thank you for doing your research (in my textbook no less!) before asking. It helps us out a lot. Okay, here goes:\n1. Diabetes in dogs is definitely type I BU-U-U-U-U-T a big part of diabetes in both types I and II is insulin resistance. Anyone who has had trouble regulating their diabetic dog on insulin has direct experience with insulin resistance. The metabolic events set in motion by feeding kibble and canned food create insulin resistance (leaving a dog prone to diabetes if something happens to its pancreas like inflammation). It also sets in motion the events that lead to Cushing's in most dogs.\n2. Speaking of Cushing's, this video series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWkMy26EfWM&list=PLaEeDeV7_crJ_IKcM7J0XQ7wj9sZhEdg4) explains why diet is the cause in most cases, and how to address it. You'll see that Si Miao San (Four Marvels) is the go-to for initial management of almost all dogs. Given its benefits in also minimizing insulin resistance AND healing the pancreas, it absolutely seems the first thing you should try along with a real food diet for your pup.\n3. Looking at your lab tests, you'll see the Na:K ratio is getting low (at 28) while the ALP is quite high. The Cushing's has been going on so long that the adrenals are burning out. You absolutely must target them first. Again, I would try Four Marvels for that first.\n4. What if Four Marvels doesn't work? I would then go to Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436). Dr. Karen Marsden and I spent an hour talking about situations like yours at Dr. Judy Morgan's Naturally Health Pets event in Orlando a week or two ago. Halscion contains adaptogens that can heal the adrenals while controlling some of the classic symptoms of Cushing's and even diabetes, but I would use Four Marvels first, every time. The high platelets suggest Halscion might help, so you could add it in if the Four Marvels doesn't fully resolve the complaints.\nHopefully this helps you (and others) out! If you give all this a try, be sure to let us know how things go. And thanks for doing your homework!"

That is the time of year when the Liver in Chinese medicine is most impoverished. The Liver depends on an adequate Blood supply to function properly, in both Eastern and Western medicine. In Eastern medicine, when that Blood is lacking (due to a seasonal decline, for example), then the Liver doesn't do it's job properly of \"coursing and draining the Qi\". That often manifests in a lack of appetite and GI inflammation and IBS. \nIn your dog's case, the vomiting of blood suggests the stomach is the focus of their concern, so a gastroscopy is a great idea. Even if they found an ulcer, however, drugs have a hard time healing it. Still, the drug called sucralfate can go a long way to soothing the stomach lining and ulcers. Maybe while waiting for the gastroscopy, ask your vet if they will dispense some for you to try. If it immediately helps, you almost don't need the procedure, as it will be proof positive that Glehnia and Rehmannia will help. Slippery Elm also helps these dogs.\nIf the sucralfate doesn't help, then Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) is often the next choice, so if you're unsure, have your friends pick up both. \n\nFor the G&R, work your way up to two or three times the label dose to be more sure of a benefit. If G&R is poorly tolerated, for sure try Adoptrex next. \n\nLastly, make sure there is about 10 to 15% plant material making up the food in the dish. Most probiotics need it to do your dog any good. There are probably a lot of right answers when it comes to probiotics. I look for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus at least, as a sign it can help heal leaky inflamed guts. But probiotics quickly die off if their favourite foods (plants) aren't present in the diet to support them.\n\nHopefully that helps! Let us know how it goes!"

Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) can also help in that regard, though they may not really need it.

        "answer": "Hi there! The history you provide above likely provides some important clues as to how to resolve these seizures and imbalance tendencies - and yes, I really think you can!\nFirst, there is their onset after vaccination. If even your neurologist is suspecting brain inflammation from vaccines, then it MUST be true, since neurologists would normally never idly speculate that. So, we know we are likely dealing with an inflammatory lesion of the brain.\nSecond, there is the timing of the seizures. Seizures that consistently worsen at the height of summer and on into late summer indicate, from a Chinese medical point of view, that they are due to Yang rising. What is Yang? In Chinese medicine, it is the fundamental force in the body that creates agitation and movement, unless it is balanced by Yin. Yin is quiet and still, so when the two are present together in equal proportions, there is no issue.\n\nYang and Yin move in and out of the body core as the seasons change. In high summer, both are present in the head and outer body, but Yin moves inward first, followed much later by Yang. If the body is lacking in Yin, there is that much less Yin in the head when it starts to internalize in mid-summer, leaving behind in the head an imbalanced surfeit of Yang. \n\nIt is this exuberance of Yang and the lack of Yin that is creating the hot body you're feeling. Until that Yang gets pumped inwards later in the fall, it has the ability to cause seizures and ataxia in the absence of Yin.\n\nSo, how do we internalize Yang and tonify Yin? Fortunately, there is a formula that does both, called Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436), made by Gold Standard Herbs. You'll see in the testimonials for the product that people are using it to conquer seizures just like your dog is experiencing, along with ataxic episodes tied to brain inflammation. There is nothing wrong with the Bupleurum and Kudzu for the MUO, but I would add in Halscion as well.\n\nA final thing you can do is to add Kan Essentials Calm Repose, which you can obtain from Aleksandra Topic among other places, using the instructions she provides in Featured posts on this page. The two make a powerful duo for combating and even curing seizure tendencies.\n\nHopefully this helps you out! If you give this a try, let everyone know as seizures and ataxia are about to become much more common for everyone in just a couple of months"

If they don't check the opposite side, though, for comparison, then the diagnosis may be erroneous. Plenty of normal dogs have somewhat lax ligaments. \nIn hindsight, the lameness may have been due to more of a simple sprain or strain of the knee. Even more likely, there is a chiropractic issue that accounts for perhaps 40% of presumed tears. That is a sacro-iliac (SI) fixation, due to SI joint inflammation on one side. \nChiropractic fixations in the SI joint can resolve themselves with movement, but while they persist, they present EXACTLY like a cruciate tear, fooling many veterinarians. \nFortunately, the conservative treatment for both a tear and an SI fixation is the same. As you suggested, I use Voltrex, along with a fresh food diet. I encourage a chiropractic evaluation for dogs with suspected cruciate tears as well, because you just never know.\nOnce lameness has resolved (like with your dog), then Lumbrex from Gold Standard Herbs is what I do to help prevent future fixations by keeping circulation to the spinal column so it's suppleness is supported and restored. The real food diet helps there, too. It seems that is the point you are at, so maybe give it a try if you want to try to prevent relapses. It is compatible with the other things you're doing.\nHope that helps!"

        "answer": "Lane Ferrante, If your dog is itchy on a real food diet, then Cessorex is pretty much the first thing we would think of. They may have another issue, though, which Cessorex is bringing to light.\nItchy dogs on real food have Shao Yang disharmonies in Chinese medical terms, which essentially is a problem moving Yang energy from the exterior (where it can keep your dog awake and itchy) to the interior (where if it gets stuck it can dry out the intestines, so to speak). Despite the moistening herbs in Cessorex, they don't target the GI as much, but meanwhile if your dog has a low grade tendency to gastritis (that you didn't otherwise know about), the other herbs in Cessorex can bring that to light. \nThe good news is that another Gold Standard Herbs product called Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) DOES soothe the stomach and heal the gastritis, while the other herbs in there are calming and help her sleep. I would add that formula in while giving half doses of the Cessorex. My guess is that after a couple of weeks, all those problems will be improving - gurgling stomach (which signals the gastritis), anxiety, itching and insomnia.\nIf you give it a try, let us know how things go. Hopefully your pup feels better soon!"

        "answer": "Kathy Boyle, so sorry to hear about your new little Frenchie. Bless you for giving her a home! Hopefully we can help. \n\nI agree to not go the surgical route if you can help it. In my youth, before I knew any better, I tried a few 'total ear canal ablations'. Even with careful surgery, post-operative fistulas are common. They can be resolved, but are a hassle, not to mention the expense and discomfort of the surgery. Still, they seemed to me like an unresolvable situation, or at least they did until I learned herbal medicine.\n\nHopefully your dog is like those other dogs I have treated herbally. I use Halscion from Gold Standard Herbs (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436). \n\nThe impact is remarkable. Although it can take a while to cure the condition, it can indeed be healed. You can have normal ears again using that formula (but I've never found any other approaches to work). Although we were always told in vet school that the scar tissue would never go away and the canal closure was permanent, in hindsight they only say that because they have no drugs with the needed vascular impact to undo all that chronic inflammation and scar tissue deposition. Halscion does do that, though.\n\nTo get your dog hearing again, feed a real food diet. That is important, as the vascular condition causing the chronic ear canal closure is called endothelial dysfunction. It promotes chronic leaking of the blood vessels leading to chronic inflammation (since WBCs just wander into the tissue unimpeded). The inflammation causes edema and the edema causes scar tissue. To get rid of the problem, you have to undo that cascade, starting with elimination of canned or kibble diets.\n\nMeanwhile, start as well with Halscion. It likewise undoes the vascular damage better than anything else I've found in the ears. After a few weeks, you'll start to be alarmed, as you'll start to see ear discharge. this is because the canal is opening and all the crap that was trapped in there is draining. Just wipe it away, flush with something safe and gentle like warm saline as needed, and keep giving the herbs and diet.\n\nEventually, it will become obvious the canal is opening and your dog will start to respond to sound again. Keep going. After many months, the ear (I kid you not!) should look normal - like it never happened!\n\nI hope after all this build up that is what you see. I chose your post because this is a heart-breaking condition that people assume needs a dastardly surgery to resolve. Instead, it all just goes away if we get out of the body's way and give it good resources to use in healing itself. If you give all this a try, let us know how things go!"

Between this post and the last one (where you mentioned Wei Ling Tang), you've covered two of the most common ones: Dampness (Wei Ling Tang) and Liver Blood deficiency (Happy Wanderer).\nThe final two conditions are related and are Shao Yang disharmony , and a condition associated with it called Stomach Dryness (i.e., Heat). The squealing gurgling sounds imply Stomach Dryness should be the next thing you target, through the Glehnia and Rehmannia (Yi Guan Jian) you mentioned. If it's going to help, other things will to, which are quick to get a hold of, like Slippery Elm bark (a powder which creates a mucilage that coats and soothes the stomach); and sucralfate, a low-risk medication which your vet likely has on hand. If either of these partially improve the situation, Glehnia and Rehmannia should heal it.\nSome of these dogs have an added Shao Yang disharmony, which traps the Yang energy in the Stomach to create all that Heat and Dryness. Adding in Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Harmonize the Qi) for dogs that always seem to need Glehnia and Rehmannia can help cure them of the problem. Since your dog is small, though, (and thus more likely to be 'purely deficient'), the Glehnia and Rehmannia might take care of things.\n\nHopefully this gets you where you need to go. Since regurgitation and a poor morning appetite are so common, be sure to let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Taylor Fay, a partial cruciate tear is not really something you can diagnose from an X-ray very easily, so it would not be enough for me to opt for some sort of surgical repair, particularly if your dog is weight bearing. Remember that chiropractic issues like sacro-iliac fixations can masquerade as cruciate tears and do not require surgery. Just a few adjustments should produce dramatic benefits. A chiropractic cause is more likely than knee inflammation, given that both X-rays show the infra-patellar fat pad (the dark area below the knee cap). That is usually all grey in cases with knee injury and inflammation.\nBesides the fact this may actually be a chiropractic issue, the other reason not to rush into surgery is that minor tears heal pretty completely with herbs (see below), chiropractic, and a real food diet. The knee is generally as good as new. That's also the goal with surgery, but it sometimes doesn't turn out that way, which could end your dog's career. Trying conservative treatment first in a dog that is substantially weight bearing does not at all preclude use of surgery later if you're not satisfied with how things are going. It also allows any ligament tears brewing on the other (non-lame) side to heal, which surgery never impacts.\nAssuming, then, you want to give conservative treatment a try:\n- seek out a local chiropractor\n- continue for now the Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) you mentioned\n- in a few weeks, add in Lumbrex to see if you can level up improvements even further. Both Voltrex and Lumbrex used in sequence can help reduce the tendency to vertebral fixations masquerading as cruciate tears\n- add some plant material to the diet to help the probiotic get established and ensure the microbiome is optimal for supporting the joints. Dysbiosis (common in cruciate and SI fixation dogs) is being increasingly shown to play a role in causing osteoarthritis and joint disease. Make it at least 1/6 of what is in the dish\nAs for PRP, it can be used in tandem with the above protocol, though I've personally never seen it necessary to facilitate healing\nHopefully this helps you out!"

        "answer": "Wendy Seybold, congratulations on your success so far with Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) for your dog's allergies. The prompt efficacy of that formula suggests you can likely cure your dog's seizure tendencies, too, or at least radically improve them further. Rather than using Voltrex, though, I would suggest Halscion from Gold Standard Herbs, probably paired with Calm Repose from Kan Essentials. \nWhy does your success with Cessorex suggest Halscion could be curative? In Chinese medical terms, seizures occur when there is 'too much Yang' in the head. Since Yang is energy, and energy moves up and out, the head is a natural place for Yang to wind up. We can't keep our Yang there indefinitely, though, or we'd never get to sleep! So there is a pump that internalizes Yang back into the body core. That pump is called the Shao Yang in Chinese medicine.\nSince Yang is forceful, anything that restrains it is likely to get tired or even break, and that is true for the Shao Yang. When the Shao Yang breaks, seizures are one of the things that can occur. Another symptom of Yang piled up in the wrong place is allergies. Your success with Cessorex, which treats the Shao Yang, tells us that something that treats seizures through the Shao Yang will likewise probably work well. That's what Halscion does.\nHalscion repairs the Shao Yang pump to make it more effective at internalizing Yang. Otherwise, if it's broken, seizures are apt to begin for the first time in January/February or six months or so later from July through November. Shao Yang seizures are also more common in the evening hours through to about 1 am.\nYang energy has an easier time internalizing if the body has ample Yin reserves. These Yin (or moisture) reserves are imagined to wrap themselves around Yang like a big wet blanket, making them less likely to bounce in uncontrolled fashion up into the head. Halscion is rich in Yin tonifying herbs as well as Yang internalizers.\nIf Halscion is kind of a complete solution for many seizures, why use Calm Repose from Kan Essentials at the same time? It contains Gastrodia, a powerful anti-seizure orchid (formerly endangered but now cultivated for use in Chinese medicine). Gastrodia is the icing on the anti-seizure cake that is baked by Halscion. It's effects are dose dependent, though, so use at least two or three times what the label says to be sure of an effect.\nCan all this work with EaseSure? I don't see a reason why not. No need to stop Cessorex either. Looking at the Bug Off product, there's nothing in there in sufficient quantities to push Yang into the head, so I think it's okay to use that, too.\nHopefully this helps you out. Thanks for the feedback on your dog's skin issues. Let us know how the seizures go, too!"

You can see the Benefit Hips and Knees has brought it down (and maybe reduced the tendency to pancreatitis as well). BH&K is a derivative of Minor Bupleurum, which has a decongesting effect on the liver. That's good news when dealing with tumors, congestive heart failure, and acute hepatitis and pancreatitis. It's not helpful in livers with microvascular dysplasia and chronic active hepatitis, which is apparently the case in your dog, given the liver enzymes are on the rise. My guess is if you switch to Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434), you can continue to lower the calcium to normal levels, while increasing blood flow to the liver and to the kidneys as well. That will help reduce any concerns about renal damage from mineralization. Meanwhile, the pancreas should continue to remain improved. Long term, since Cessorex has anti-cancer effects, it may even take out the parathyroid tumor, making it a comprehensive and inexpensive solution for Nova's various problems.\nAs for Rem, I'm glad the tumors are well contained. Try those two formulas together for now (in ample doses). If there is still a lot of acute bladder inflammation, then we sometimes add Four Marvels to the mix, but for now just proceed with that original recommendation and see what happens.\nI'm glad you have the support of your vet for these holistic approaches! It's hard enough doing battle with serious illness without also feeling like you have a target on your back every time you go to the vet clinic. \nLet us know how things go and good luck!"

During that time, owners experience what you just did: a seeming recovery, then a strain followed by more limping. \n\nWhat's going on there is that your dog's new ligament got caught by surprise when new forces coming from a new direction were suddenly placed on it. That triggers an inflammatory response, but also a renewed effort by the ligament to toughen itself up so that those kind of forces coming from that direction don't bother it in the future. \n\nNote that this remodeling phase only really happens in dogs fed real food. Processed diets greatly hinder the ability of the ligament to heal and remodel, making them susceptible to full tears and the need for surgery. So if you haven't introduced a real food diet, now might be the time.\n\nOnce a dog is limping less and well into the remodeling phase, we typically add Lumbrex from Gold Standard Herbs (the same place you got the Voltrex) to help ensure the newly healed ligament is maximally suffused with nourishment and oxygen. It will also help keep the spine supple, so that the sciatic nerve roots are not being pinched (which is otherwise a common problem in dogs). Pinching a nerve means that the power in the muscle it serves drops by at least 50% and is also a source of pain in its own right. Sciatic nerve root pain (sciatica) presents JUST LIKE a cruciate tear, yet vets are not taught it exists as an issue in dogs. Lumbrex helps address it, along with chiropractic treatments here and there.\n\nAs for Myos, no problem to add it in there into the mix. I don't think it will be a game changer like Voltrex or Lumbrex (and a real food diet), but it is a helpful adjunct.\n\nHopefully your pup feels better soon! Thanks for letting us know how he's doing. If you follow the above advice, your dog should be able to eventually get back to jumping on and off the couch with impunity."

        "answer": "Peggy O'Connor, if your surgeon is as skilled as Dr. Karen Marsden, then incontinence may never arise. When my wife has had to remove both glands, I don't think she ever had a dog come back with incontinence issues. That said, I have some suggestions that will hopefully make sure your dog doesn't need the surgery to begin with.\nFirst, even though the anal glands are located in the 'nether regions', from a Chinese medical perspective, they are among the most 'peripheral' structures of the body. That means they can be as hard to get circulation to as the tips of the ears, the toenails, and the cornea. Why is that important? Many dogs, especially those on processed diets (i.e., kibble and canned, including prescription diets) are prone to a condition known as endothelial dysfunction. Essentially, it is a condition of compromised circulation, especially to these distal areas. The vessels in the affected regions are attenuated and leaky, which means inflammation is easy to get going but never resolves; and the tissue never heals. When old time naturopaths approached issues like this, the first thing they did was 'restore the causes of health'. In our case, that means feeding a real food meat-and-vegetable diet, probably supplemented with a Lactobacillus and Bifiobacterium probiotic. The z/d has to go, in my experience.\nSecond, we need to reverse the endothelial dysfunction and 'actively resolve' the smouldering inflammation in the anal gland region. For that we need, in Chinese terms, Blood movers that target the 'upper burner', which means outer body and peripheral structures. The formula for that is Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood, though you could likely also get a decent effect from Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) for less cost and a lower dose.\nThe herbs in those formulas will cause the vessels to dilate, grow yet seal, allowing more oxygen and nourishment to the region while causing inflammatory cells, free radicals and debris to be drained away. \nAnother thing that happens when endothelial dysfunction is reversed and inflammation is actively resolved is that the immune cells in the region change. Instead of destructive inflammatory neutrophils, we have appearing on the scene watchful vigilant macrophages. These are 'first responders', who watch for infection quietly, but otherwise keep their cool, which means the tissue stays healed. If a bad guy were to appear on the scene, they quickly mount an immune response, minimizing the amount of destruction that has to occur to get the job done. A herbal formula that bolsters this phase of things is Lift the Qi by Kan Essentials. It can be used with Cessorex (or Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood). If you go the Kan route, make sure you give double or triple doses.\nAnother thing you can add to back up the influence of both these formulas is Harmonize the Qi (aka Minor Bupleurum). If you're using Cessorex, then you don't need it as it's already in there.\nThe diet and the herbs should get the job done, but let's talk fiber. The idea behind pumpkin is that it contains fiber (and several antioxidants) that bulk and soften the stool so that it passively presses on the gland as it's passed or that the stool is passed more often. Note, however, that if it's in a capsule (and not supplied with its own moisture like canned pumpkin is), it sucks UP available moisture in the GI instead and can make the stool harder. This might especially be the case in a kibble fed dog, unless they are drinking a lot to compensate for the processing of their diet. All this to say that, even though the pumpkin is now in a fancy package from your vet, it may not work as well as canned pumpkin from the grocery store, especially when added to a real food diet.\nLastly, if that region in the photo is still extremely sensitive, then homeopathic Hepar Sulph (I use 30C strength) given three times a day for up to a few days can greatly take down acute redness and inflammation. Once the tenderness is substantially resolved, and the focus is on full resolution and prevention, the above herbs should do the trick.\nSorry for the long answer, but anal gland issues are a big concern of pet owners. I'm hoping by going into a lot of detail here, I can help a lot of people besides yourself. Let us know how things go so we can 'complete the circle'!"

        "answer": "Kayla Nicole, thank you for sharing your success story with Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) in getting on top of your dog's allergies! That's very heartening to hear you're almost there, and I'm sure many people will relate to the tale of perpetual struggle that leads to cupboards bursting with products that don't work. My goal at Gold Standard Herbs was to come up with things that almost always work, without a lot of additional help other than good food.\nWhen Cessorex doesn't quite get the job done, there are two things I reach for first, both of which you mentioned.\nLift the Qi (Kan Essentials' version of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, or Ginseng and Astragalus Combination) helps bolster an immune response in the skin and the gut if it is lacking, so dogs can get on top of yeast and bacterial infections. In your dog's case, itch ramped up following its use, so we know the problem wasn't your dog not being able to mount an effective immune response. If anything, it was your dog being inefficient in its response, producing unproductive inflammation.\nIn that situation of severe acute inflammation in a real food fed dog, or inflammation that gets worse with Lift the Qi, it can take Cessorex a long time to get on top of it. To help it out and move things along, we add Cool the Blood. If in doubt, all three formulas can be used together. \nCool the Blood is anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory, so it can help conquer nasty current skin issues. It is designed to vent Heat pathogens from deep inside the body all the way to the body surface. In Chinese medical theory, those pathogens invade via the dorsum of the body, right where your dog is experiencing a lot of inflammation. It's like your dog read the textbooks! Even the location on the outside of the paw is considered in the same dermal zone as where the lesions are on the back, so I would expect Cool the Blood to help everything. Remember that you may need three times the dose on the label to get a significant benefit from the product, so work your way up to that dose as soon as you've determined your dog is fine with the product.\nNone of this advice precludes you from using benign topical anti-yeast treatments and anti-yeast protocols from other companies, but that said, I would expect Cool the Blood and Cessorex (+/- Lift the Qi) to address the whole issue and be curative. Here's hoping that is the case, so that you can 'thin the herd' of supplements in the cupboard!"

I've used it successfully to help heal low grade ligament inflammation, allowing the ligament to tighten up once again and bring the hip firmly into the socket.\nDo you see the bunny-hopping gait in your dog when she is running? That might imply some pain or weakness in the hip joints. Watch for that disappearing with the use of the Voltrex. \nOnce maximum benefits, if any, are seen with the Voltrex use, add the Lumbrex. Voltrex helps heal the vascular architecture in the ligament, and then Lumbrex helps ensure an ample supply of blood through that newly repaired ligament, so it can be well nourished, oxygenated, and become as strong as possible.\nIf you give this approach a try, let us know how it goes! I get asked a lot about how to prevent lameness from hip dysplasia and cruciate tears, so if you see an improvement, I'm sure many people would love to hear about it!"

The freeze drying of their product gets around the article's concern that the species won't get along well together in the bottle. Gussy's only comes back to life once it enters the GI, and then it has its favourite food source to feed on while it looks for a 'parking space' on the gut wall. To my mind, that raises the chances of the probiotic surviving and thriving. Also make sure your dog has a significant quantity of plant material in its diet or the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium will eventually starve and die.\nRegarding the product you're thinking of, it's fine in theory, as long as you have that diet in place. Note, though, that it contains inulin as a prebiotic. In theory, this is supposed to act like the fermented plant material in the Gussys Gut product and feed the bacteria while they are getting established. In many dogs (and humans), however, it's indigestible nature can cause diarrhea and cramping, so be aware of that if you see it happening in your dog after using that product."

They are more concerning when present persistently, in large numbers or in association with other evidence of renal disease, none of which applies to you. One thing to bear in mind, though, is that the kidneys tubules are one of the first organs damaged (within minutes) following a meal that promotes metabolic syndrome and associated inflammation. That applies to almost every dog eating a kibble or canned diet, especially if they are at least a little overweight. If your dog had a commercial dog food meal or treat an hour or two prior to the urinalysis, that could theoretically cause the appearance of granular casts. As for next steps, I would just check the urine (away from any meals) in a month or so. If the casts disappear, then they are not likely a significant problem for you"

        "answer": "Carolyn Kong, kidney disease often gets worse mid-winter and improves as spring and summer approach. This is because the kidneys are very reliant on peripheral blood flow, siphoning off as much as 25% of the blood flowing through the aorta to supply their needs. In mid-winter, peripheral blood flow is reduced (particularly in dogs with heart murmurs), impairing kidney blood flow and reducing their ability to function. Now what warm weather is approaching, he hopefully will do better.\nYou can enhance the effects of the warm weather and mitigate the effects of the cold weather with a formula called Rehmannia Eight from Kan Essentials. Give at least three times the label dose to be sure your dog improves. Many studies show an ability of Rehmannia to enhance renal function and resolve low grade proteinuria, just by ensuring greater delivering more nourishing blood flow and oxygen to the kidneys.\nTargeting the protein leakage turns out to be very important as persistent proteinuria promotes renal inflammation, which begets more damage. Most vets just use blood pressure drugs to address it, but the drugs don't always work, and in a dog with a lower UPC ratio or early stage kidney disease, they can make things somewhat worse. With Rehmannia, we can target the proteinuria and not worry we will make things worse.\nIf you need help finding Rehmannia Eight, contact group member Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/?multi_permalinks=1420037418560133&hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&__cft__[0]=AZXWhLAw-yM4p_pZ4P66jfvQzpEuejq-m2nO9J74f0xsVVRbWvnNnuVeqbciSpsXzCmr_TX1iehYpAhmGEqnTwmW8eZ0eO-W21wTcAmQSv8bRX18k0TtUhgYrT4ZLjAGShtUSRf1leQa2dn0Xt50pqLKJYvgAFDVWKkjtfv-I4TDcw&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\nSomething else you can use at the same time from Kan Essentials is Blood's Palace. It, too, has Rehmannia in it, but also helps the heart to pump blood more effectively, which will boost blood flow to the kidneys while taking pressure off the heart. I think if you use both, you will see significant continued improvements.\nGood luck and let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Cindy Duke, skin inflammation that occurs even when a dog is on a real food diet make it more likely an animal is suffering from a true immune disorder, rather than the simple ramping up of inflammation that is induced by feeding a processed diet. That said, the feeding of kibble in the morning is not going to do you any favours. At least strive for a freeze-dried diet if it has to be processed. The application of dry heat to food markedly ramps up it's inflammatory potential, including by dramatically increasing the production of AGEs (advanced glycation endproducts). Something else for you to Google as you try to figure out your dog!\nThere are two immune issues - local deficiency and systemic excess - and they co-exist, despite seemingly being opposite conditions, because they are happening in separate areas. Immune suppressant drugs help palliate symptoms because they deal with immune excess, but they make immune deficiency worse in the process. Thus, they are never curative, so they are used long term. Prolonged use can produce immune suppression disorders like tumors and septicemia, and can even cause the drugs to stop working, as the local immune deficiency component becomes so severe.\nWhere's the immune deficiency exactly? Two places. The skin and the gut. Both are very important in the manifestation of skin inflammation. In the gut, a lack of immunity allows undesirable microbes to adhere to the gut wall and multiply, causing gut wall damage that culminates in what we call 'leaky gut'. In the skin, a lack of immune competency means yeast and bacterial infections can proliferate, feeding on the filtered plasma and damaged tissue that comes from a non-stop but ineffectual immune response. The improvements you saw on Lift the Qi were because the formula boosts immunity in both locations, helping  your dog 'take back the neighborhood' on its gut wall, and oust some of the bacterial and yeast pathogens on the skin.\nThe big issue, though, is excess systemic immunity, and this is what Cessorex targets. The systemic immune system is an intermediary between the gut and the skin. It notes the gut wall becoming increasingly tattered, worries about an impending gut wall breach where zillions of bacteria might then invade, and sends out chemicals and cells to tell everyone to up their game and be on the lookout. Tiny low grade inflammatory processes you might not even notice (such as to a mild yeast infection) suddenly become five alarm fires, all because of the systemic immune system's reaction to the leaking gut wall. This is what we call a cell mediated hypersensitivity - it's the cells of the immune system creating the rash.\nCessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) contains Minor Bupleurum, the only thing I know of that can simultaneously calm down systemic immunity while boosting local immunity. It's in a lot of other Gold Standard formulas, too, but is paired with Blood tonics and movers in Cessorex, since they seem needed to help 'actively resolve' the 'wheel spinning' inflammation in the skin. \nFrom a Chinese medical perspective, Cessorex is a Shao Yang harmonizer. The Shao Yang is the network of structures in the body which regulates the flow of Heat (or Yang) and with it the flow of Blood in the body. It avoids Yang being bottled up in the exterior, often producing CNS disorders like seizures and vestibular syndrome, or the interior, often producing gastric disorders and inflammation along GI-related channels like the Stomach and Gall Bladder. The Gall Bladder channel runs down the side of the torso, neck and legs, right where your dog is most inflamed in the photo. The image is thus proof positive that Cessorex should work.\nSo, what is taking so long? When a dog is profoundly inflamed, you need an additional formula that likewise targets the Shao Yang but is anti-inflammatory, just to cool the skin off a bit. Use it with Cessorex and, if necessary, Lift the Qi as well. That formula is called Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials (the same place you got Lift the Qi). As with Lift the Qi, use two or three times the label dose in order to be more sure of an effect.\nHopefully with time, this trio will finally improve your dog. Naturally other stones should be turned over like testing for scabies, etc. I presume your team of vets has done all that.\nLastly, put some good guy bacteria in your dog's intestinal tract. Lactobacillus to produce propionate which will help regulate and calm the immune system; and Bifidobacterium to help repair the tattered wall. Then, as long as you see slow incremental improvement, you just have to hang in there and be patient, if you're not going to palliate here and there with medication. How long it takes to resolve inflammation is up to your dog, but generally, severe cases require longer time periods.\nHopefully you finally get a payoff, Cindy!"

That is great news! Because it worked well, it implies related formulas should take care of some of these other issues, including the heart issues, related cough, and arthritis.\nThe trio I'm thinking of includes Voltrex and Cessorex from Gold Standard Herbs along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus). That formula is the same as Lift the Qi if you can access the Kan Essentials line. If you are sourcing it somewhere else, make sure you get the version that has Panax Ginseng in it, not Codonopsis. \nIf you tried half doses of all three, you should get a good effect, as they all are synergistic. All three will work together to reduce pulmonary congestion at night, driving blood out into the periphery where it will help resolve joint inflammation and take back pressure off the heart. Additionally, the trio will work together help improve circulation to the liver to resolve liver enzyme elevations there, while BZYQT rounds out the effects of Halscion on treating anxiety. Hopefully, then, you can access those, as they should all help your dog a lot.\nAs for CoQ10, it's no problem to use larger doses. I don't have particular brands to recommend. There are many. As long as the company has a reputation for good quality assurance, any pure CoQ10 supplement they make should be fine.\nLastly, have your vet make sure there is no fluid build up in the lungs. If they hear 'crackles' then you will need to add a diuretic. My preference is to use Dandelion extracts (of the aerial portions of the plant, not the root). \nHopefully this helps you out! I'm sure if I saw your dog in person, I could come up with a simpler more elegant solution, but the recommendations here should provide broad-based support"

Usually this is caused by chiropractic issues in the neck. If you can find someone local to check her out, have them carefully palpate the atlas for fixations, as they are usually at the epi-center of this kind of problem. If there is a problem there, check the sacro-iliac joints for fixations and also the tempero-mandibular joints. If fixations are present and not addressed in these locations, the atlas issue will come back. \nA herbal formula that can help keep the spine supple and vertebrae moving freely is Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs. It also helps the muscles be less prone to spasm. Other anti-spasmodic products that could be useful here are Valerian root extract (a western herb) and Liver Support Formula, from Kan Essentials. All three products can be used together if need be, and along with chiropractic care, will likely help stop the problem from happening"

        "answer": "Halya Herah, reverse sneezing is in most cases caused by naso-pharyngeal swelling, which causes the soft palate to end up stuck in the wrong location in relation to the trachea. \n\nIf you look at the image, you can see that the windpipe (trachea) is closest to the underside of the neck while the esophagus is closest to the back of the neck. The free end of the soft palate is dangling there dangerously close to the windpipe opening. During swallowing, the tongue moves backwards, pushing closed the windpipe entrance. The soft palate moves to the left side of the image, popping over the entrance of the wind pipe to presses against the very back of the throat, cutting off the nasal passage so food doesn't get pushed up in there. Instead, it all goes down the esophagus.\n\nWhat about after eating? The soft palate should pop back down into its resting position, allowing air from the nose to once again get down the windpipe. If the palate ending gets stuck in the 'swallow' position, the nose stays obstructed and all that snorting and snoring starts to occur as the dog tries to suck air in past the palate anyway. \n\nYou can remedy this usually by just sticking your finger down to the back of the throat. The dog moves it tongue around and contracts all its throat muscles in response, and all that movement pops the palate back where it's supposed to be...until next time.\n\nSo how do we stop this happening in the first place? If we could just make the palate a little smaller, it would flap around freely and not get stuck on the rim of the windpipe as it tries to move into the 'breathe' position. The way you make the palate smaller is to remove any extra swelling. Sometimes the swelling is short-lived - e.g., from an episode of kennel cough or the use of an intra-nasal vaccine. Chronic swelling is caused by 'allergies' and if you've been reading my posts, you know there are actually two mechanisms for those.\n\nThe first mechanism happens in about half of dogs, especially those that are allergic kibble- and canned-fed. The easy calories causes a shift in metabolism that, in turn, activates the Innate immune system. This immune system is all about mast cells, edema, 'complement fixation', C-reactive protein, histamine, and neutrophils. Antibodies and the true (Adaptive) immune system are not involved. All you need to do is feed a real food diet and use a formula like Three Seeds Combination from Kan Essentials to permanently resolve this kind of issue. Three Seeds has the benefit of making more space inside the kidneys to allow greater renal perfusion, so it's safe to use for older dogs like yours where kidney function is of increasing interest.\n\nThe second type of allergic reaction is due to the Adaptive immune system with its antibodies, lymphocytes, T helper cells, etc. This immune system is responsible for allergies in real-food fed dogs, especially if the diet is lacking plant material. Certain parts of the microbiome starve to death and stop making compounds which regulate the immune system. Putting plants back in the diet (but while still 'keeping it real') and adding Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sets the stage for a cure. Meanwhile, to calm down the Adaptive immune system, we use Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434). Cessorex has a very balanced effect on the kidneys, too, so is a safe choice for even a geriatric dog.\n\nHopefully this information helps conquer the reverse sneezing. If you try out the advice, let us know if it works. It's a common issue, even though it is generally just a nuisance. Still, why put up with it if you don't have to? I'm sure your dog would agree"

        "answer": "Ange Agnes, one of the great things about Chinese medicine is it \"sees things coming\" so that we can prevent things that we just have to cross our fingers about in conventional terms. \n\nFor example, if a dog is prone to true allergies (that is, skin inflammation despite a real food diet), then we know it's also prone to cruciate tears, hemangionsarcoma, GDV, and a host of scary diseases. Such prospects would be nerve-racking were it not that the same basic formula is therapeutic in almost all those conditions, and that is Minor Bupleurum. \n\nDespite its utility, this is a rarely used formula in holistic medicine, because most Chinese medicine education programs for vets worldwide are based on the human Chinese medical training programs, where the genius of two thousand year-old Minor Bupleurum is no longer understood so it is seldom taught. The formula is not understood because the disease it treats - Shao Yang disharmony - likewise poorly understood.\n\nThe inventor of the formula, Zhang Zhongjing, is probably one of the most brilliant medical minds to walk the earth. After all, what drugs do you think we will be using in 4,000 AD? If you're like me, you would have trouble thinking of even one that would stand that test of time by being both wildly effective yet very safe. Minor Bupleurum fits that bill, and once he invented it, Zhang Zhongjing likewise realized perhaps 25% of the patients he treated benefit from its use. \n\nTo access that formula in the modern-day animal world, there are only three companies ANYWHERE that provide it: Natural Path (for vets), Kan Essentials (based on Natural Path and technically for vets, but which we sneak to you), and Gold Standard Herbs.  the latter being the first company in history to provide prescription strength herbal formulas that almost always work directly to pet parents. Much of the Gold Standard line has Minor Bupleurum at its core.\n\nSo, for your pup, we know that one or more of the Gold Standard line (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products) should help your dog A LOT, since it has two (so far) of the conditions that tell us your dog is prone to Shao Yang disharmony: CCL tears and allergies. If we institute it now, we can likely stop all those other nasty problems from ever developing. So, which one should we use?\n\nNow that you've had two surgeries done and they (likely) took out any remnants of the torn ligaments during that surgery, Voltrex may not do a lot of good unless there was lingering arthritis, because there are no ligaments left for it to heal. From a Chinese medical perspective, there is a fleeting initial step on the way to Shao Yang disharmony and cruciate tears which Lumbrex addresses, so using that next winter is an option for you. Winter is when that initial step - a so-called Tai Yang invasion - is most likely to happen. Again, though, if mobilty concerns are now off the table, maybe we should focus on the allergies instead.\n\nCessorex, as you mentioned, is THE formula to both treat and prevent allergies in dogs on real food diets (which any itchy dog should be as step one of their treatment plan). Besides Minor Bupleurum (which not only treats joints, but  and is anti-cancer but regulates the immune system and heals leaky gut), Cessorex contains Blood-tonifying and moving herbs to help restore normal skin blood flow, thus helping resolve inflammation. This enhancement of peripheral circulation by Cessorex may actually have a preventive effect on arthritic concerns as well, because joints likewise break down when they don't have good blood flow. Meanwhile, the particular ratios of herbs in Cessorex give it a very balanced and supporting effect on the liver and the kidneys, making it suitable for long term use.\n\nAll told, until your dog starts limping, I would use Cessorex. Start it in spring and use it through to when you know the allergies normally disappear. If no symptoms materialize, you may only need it for a week or two the year after. Keep up as well a meat-and-vegetable real food diet and consider adding a probiotic containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to ensure efficacy. If allergies appear to be off the table next fall, consider Lumbrex for the winter months as you shift your focus to preventing mobility issues.\n\nIf you think of it, let us know what happens. As mentioned, the real power of Chinese medical thinking and its formulas is to actually prevent issues from happening in a non-toxic way. No western pharmaceuticals can really make a similar claim, with our efforts in that department really being limited to vaccinations. The idea of a safe drug to prevent cruciate tears or allergies is currently the stuff of science fiction so far as western medicine is concerned. Thus, if you end up stopping next year's allergies in their tracks, I'm guessing many people will want to hear about it."

A mass visible on an imaging study like a CT scan or an MRI can sometimes, depending on location, tell you what type of tumor it likely is, and thus what the treatment options are. Since treatment is likely expensive as well, it doesn't seem worth doing in the imaging if you can't then follow up with treatment. Sometimes CSF taps can yield abnormalities that make specific tumors more likely, but a negative CSF tap doesn't mean a brain tumor is not present. A response to Anipryl would be unlikely if signs were due to a brain tumor, but not all CCD dogs respond to Anipryl.\nOptions improve a little bit from the Chinese medical perspective. Both CCD and brain tumors in dogs are caused by \"too much Yang in the head\". Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs is useful in both conditions, as well as other look-alike conditions like stroke and vestibular disease. How could one product benefit all of these? All of these conditions are associated with the same basic perturbation of circulation in the brain, so the same therapy can improve them all. Because the brain is in a sealed chamber, it is intolerant of any new thing that takes up space, such as increases in blood flow and edema. This vascular issue is a feature of inflammation from any cause including vestibular disease, but also the pressure induced by an expanding tumor or hemorrhagic stroke. Despite being cerebrally decongesting, the formula is rich in catalpol, which helps improve mentation in cognitive issues including Alzheimer's. Thus, no matter what is behind pacing, circling, sleeplessness, head tilts, seizures and vision loss, it's one of my main go-tos, and usually yields positive results."

It will not produce bladder stones, if that is what you're worried about. It's far greater a risk to not give enough calcium, than to give more than what is needed.\nAs for how to support your dog's kidneys, if you look at other posts, you'll see me recommend people get a UPC test done on their dog's urine. This test measures how much protein is excreted compared to creatinine. Protein shouldn't be in there and creatinine should be, so a urinary protein to creatinine ratio indicates definite renal issues.\nIf the UPC ratio comes back as 3.0 and under, then a product like Rehmannia Eight usually will support the kidneys and help bring urinary protein back down, but delivering more blood to the kidneys. If it is over 4.0, then the kidneys are subacutely inflamed, often by the same process that is jacking up the liver enzymes. Then we use (for a few weeks) something like Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs to bring the protein back down to about 3 or lower. Once that reduction has occurred, we then switch to Rehmannia Eight to try to maintain the patient going forward.\nHopefully this advice helps you out. Good luck with your pup!"

Alternatively, you can try a freeze dried product like Gussys Gut (https://gussysgut.pxf.io/c/4643206/1738316/19832). \nMake sure the probiotic has Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in it. These two fill niches that are empty in Shao Yang dogs. We know Shao Yang disharmony is the cause because it commonly produces lymphoma and also is the number one cause of an enlarged spleen of any cause. \nBecause your dog almost certainly has that Chinese diagnosis, they almost certainly will respond to LSA Combination, which www.atimetohealherbs.com sells to veterinarians. It may well facilitate a remission and allow reduced doses of pred to be used. Pred alone will give you a couple of weeks, but then often produces a rapid decline, so finding another solution is important. See if your vet will help you and get the product for you. A Time to Heal has notes from oncologist Erin Bannink on the formula. She has extensively tested it in her integrative cancer hospital. Besides combating the tumor, it will probably normalize your dog's digestion.\nHopefully this helps you out, Debbie. If you give this a try, let us know how it goes."

        "answer": "Kasi Santarelli, your impatience is understandable, given how unhappy your dog is. Note, though, that it is only conventional medicine that can be expected to yield an immediate impact (and sometimes it fails, too). Drugs do so because they constitute a massive amount of a single compound targeting a single receptor and metabolic pathway, to correct a single (but important) aspect of a disease, like itch. This narrow focus also explains why drugs are seldom curative, as chronic diseases are multi-faceted self propagating dynamics. To effect a cure, several pathways have to be acted upon in a meaningful way all at once. It's true that some people have seen instant results with their dogs allergies on Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434), but usually this is because the dog had been primed to improve by everything else that the owner had been doing, and they were just missing the action of Cessorex at the center of the disease process to effect resolution.\nWhat are those facets that you need to take care of in your dog? Many raw fed dogs are not given any carbs or plant material, but unfortunately perhaps half of dogs need them included in a significant way. Up to 1/3 of the diet should be plant-based in these dogs.\nWhy is that so essential? It appears there are certain species in the bacteria of our gut that use the plant material to produce compounds that are then absorbed and cause the immune system to function normally. When the plant material is missing, so are those bacteria (since they have literally starved to death), leaving the immune system dysfunctional because it is adapted to this outside support.\nThus, to prime your dog to respond to Cessorex, you need to make sure the bacteria are present (like Lactobacillus or Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium) and you need to make sure there is ample plant content in the food (as much as a third of what is in the dish).\nEven once those factors are in play, it's important to remember a dog's immune system is like a bicycle wheel. When you flip a bike over and start it spinning, it can take a long time to wind down. The same with your dog's immune system. Cessorex helps 'speed up' the 'winding down', but it still takes time. For dogs that are more severely inflamed and itchy, I recommend adding in Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials. Aleksandra Topic, a friend of the page, has instructions for sourcing it from her if you can't find it. Here are the instructions: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nIf your dog has soft stools at all, it may not be doing a proper job of digesting the raw. That can aggravate the recovery in skin disease dogs. Lightly cooking the food can help with that, as can formulas other than Cessorex.\nLastly, if you are both miserable, you shouldn't allow yourselves to suffer. We expect the above protocol to definitely START improving itch within two to three weeks. It's up to the dog how long it will take to cure allergies. Sometimes for the sake of everyone's sanity, drugs have to be used - maybe in a low dose or just for a short term. I always try to get by without them, but the drugs exist for a reason and can definitely alleviate suffering in the very short term, despite not at all being curative in the long term, so keep that in mind.\nMeanwhile, we are all with you here.

        "answer": "Lindsey Rudolph, sorry to hear about your dog's debacle! I've only had one disc blowout case that I could not get back on their feet with integrative medicine, and it was a rare type of disc disease. I've always found the type of condition you're wrestling with to be amenable to treatment, which for me includes:\n- acupuncture\n- chiropractic\n- herbs\nChiropractic is essential and can help decompress the cord immediately, so once acute inflammation has died down, some gentle chiropractic (ideally using an Activator) is called for.\nAcupuncture (when the pulse is used as a guide to therapy) helps normalize circulation as quickly as possible, so that inflammation ceases and healing can begin.\nAs for herbs, there are three stages to disc disease, with a formula for each one:\n- Bupleurum and Kudzu Clearning Formula is indicated in the first few days following prolapse to de-inflame the cord\n- After that, if there is no limb movement to speak of, Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs is needed next. It helps reduce nitric oxide (NO) inside the cord that stops all signals from passing from the brain to the legs. Once those NO levels subside, conscious limb movement begins right away. Once you see that, I would add in Lumbrex from Gold Standard, while continuing my acupuncture and chiropractic. As limb movement continues to improve, you can then phase out the Voltrex.\nRehab and physical therapists can help you greatly in restoring limb movement as quickly as possible, while also showing you how you can help your dog practice using their limbs at home. They have many aids to facilitate that, so see who is in your area.\nHopefully your dog recovers soon. It's rare to see repeated disc injury on a raw diet, if digestion is strong. Nevertheless, if that is the case, then sustained use of Lumbrex afterwards will help keep the discs as supple as possible and less at risk of rupture.\nLet us know how it goes and best wishes for a speedy recovery!"

        "answer": "Marce Richo, yes, I would see if there is an obvious recurrence of a severe fixation that could explain the decline following chiropractic. Make sure they check the atlas. Fixations there can cause almost quadriplegia in some animals, but are regularly missed. Atlas fixations are promulgated by sacro-iliac fixations, so the lumbo-sacral region should also be be carefully palpated and adjusted if need be.\nIf a dog is very sensitive to adjustments, they either have severe muscle spasm tendencies (which Lumbrex treats) or they have a very irritated cord. It should be obvious to anyone palpating your dog if the muscles are tight and spastic. If they are, two things you can add are Valerian root (a Western herbal tincture that is easy to find online) and Liver Support Formula from Kan Essentials. \nIf no spasms, then you're looking at cord inflammation, for which I would try Bupleurum and Kudzu Clearing Formula from Kan Essentials. It's the best one I know of for resolving severe acute nerve inflammation of almost any cause. If you need help sourcing either of these Kan formulas, you can contact Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nLastly, if you have not done a home DM test on your dog, you should, in case that is the problem. Here's an example of one such test: https://easy-dna.com/degenerative-myelopathy-dna-testing/ If your dog has DM, then you'd want to load up on DM Formula (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-DM-Formula-85g-p647327435) ASAP and ease off of Lumbrex and other tonic herbs.\nLastly, whether disc disease, stenosis, or DM, switching to a real food diet will help slow disease progression, so give that some thought.\nGood luck and let us know how things go. Hopefully you can get your dog back on all four 'cylinders' soon!"

At least she won't vaccinate a sick animal, though. That's progress! Meanwhile, though, I would wonder if what you need is a new vet, since a dog still not having had its rabies at six months is hardly unusual. There are probably lots of vets for whom that is the norm and who would likely be willing to render necessary care without the shot being on board just yet.\nAs for whether you should worry:\n- it usually takes two shots to get a severe vaccine reaction like anaphylaxis\n- I've used homeopathic Thuja (I use 30C potency) to apparently forestall adverse reactions. I give it three times a day beginning two days before the shot and extending through to two days afterwards. I've noticed dogs that are normally sensitive to the vaccine often don't show symptoms on that protocol. I've also noticed the level of immunity produced by the shot is blunted, though. Still, at least you'd have fulfilled your legal requirement.\nSpeaking of - find out if it's a legal requirement in your state! Maybe it's not.\nNow what if you don't vaccinate but your dog has zero chance of exposure (by never even remotely being in the vicinity of bats, raccoons, foxes, etc.)? Is that a problem? Assuming you can successfully remove all risk of a wildlife encounter, you still have the issue of what happens if your dog nips someone. If she isn't vaccinated for rabies, they can make a federal case out of it and insist your dog is quarantined until proven not infected.\nThose are all the things that spring to mind that might help your situation. Hopefully they help you figure out your strategy!"

If your dog doesn't have crystals in the urine and that's what they are giving you, you may want to save some money and make your own food for your dog. There is a Home Cooked Diet you can download in our Files.\nAs for how to address the UTI, in a post I did just a few moments ago, one thing I mentioned was that antibiotics can NEVER clear an infection if the immune system is lacking. This is almost always the case in refractory infections in young animals. Chinese medicine calls this a Wei Qi deficiency. In a dog so young, the only other cause would be an anatomical abnormality allowing an infection to persist, most commonly a persistent urachal diverticulum. You might be better off not feeding a crystal diet (if that's what you're using) and applying the money saved to an ultrasound of the bladder. If there is an anatomical abnormality there, the ultrasound should detect it.\nIn the absence of a developmental anomaly, you're looking at immune deficiency. My favourite immune stimulant for the bladder is Lift the Qi, which is the Kan Essentials version of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus). Use that along with the antibiotics, which hopefully are supposed to be effective for the type of bacteria she has. (Note, it it's always the same bacteria, it raises the chances of a lesion in the bladder where the bacteria are hiding, which an ultrasound should be able to detect).\nIf you use Lift the Qi, since you're in distress, work your way up to as high as five times the label dose. At some point along the way, the incontinence and bleeding should start to subside.\nNaturally there are MANY other products advocated for UTIs. Cranberry concentrates can (imperfectly) help prevent recurrent E coli infections. D-mannose can help boost bladder immunity. Other herbs can help fight infections (but you are already addressing that with drugs). Herbs like Marshmallow or Slippery Elm can help coat the bladder wall and soothe it. \nIf you were to use just ONE supplement, though, I would try Lift the Qi as it is the most powerful by far of all these ideas, and addresses every symptom you're seeing. If you give it a try, let us know how it goes!"

        "answer": "Catherine Wolf Thesen, it's no problem to use those three products together. They all look after a different stage of 'expelling pathogens' from the GI:\n- Protect the Middle pushes pathogens from the surface layer. From a biomedical perspective, it is a broad spectrum antimicrobial, but does not compromise circulation to the gut lining (whereas a lot of our drugs like Flagyl do, because they are anti-inflammatory and thus act like ice packs)\n- Fun Fact: antimicrobials are NEVER able to clear an infection on their own. They always rely on the immune system to do most of the heavy lifting. Lift the Qi is immune stimulating, helping to combat infectious organisms adherent to the gut wall. It also helps to normalize bowel wall motility so it isn't too active, as that will produce diarrhea.\n- Sometimes infections are 'deeper' than the surface layer of the body from a Chinese perspective. Adoptrex addresses that deeper layer. From a biomedical perspective, it backs up what Lift the Qi does in improving gut wall immunity. It also calms down excess immune agitation on the interior gut wall that can produce damage. Lastly, it helps bolster digestive power in the intestinal lining while resolving inflammation there.\nThe three products thus form a pretty comprehensive trio that can help resolve confirmed GI infections in record time, while taking steps to help ensure they don't get reinfected in the future."

        "answer": "Anousshka Silva, an enduring lesion on the distal limbs is almost always due to \"Blood deficiency\" from a Chinese medical point of view, with resultant stasis. So, too, are immune mediated conditions of the nail beds, so from a holistic perspective, the two are closely related even though your vet undoubtedly sees them as different. Even from a western perspective, good circulation is needed to deliver the immune system and heal a wound. \nThe edges of the wound are rounded, so the lesion has stalled out in its healing process, making it akin to a bed sore, which likewise develop over top of bony prominences. The herb used in Chinese medicine for that is Astragalus (Huang Qi). Given that we need to get the Astragalus to the paws, it needs to be carried in a so-called Qi and Blood mover. In short, this is a recipe for Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials, or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus) if you have to source it somewhere else. A note of caution: many companies cheap out on the product by not including Ginseng, but you should always use a version that contains Ginseng, since so much of what we want the formula to do in animals is reliant on the presence of that herb.\nTwo other things you can do to move healing along:\n1) see if a local veterinary acupuncturist is around who can put needles around the wound. We call that Circling the Dragon, and it serves to help drive the blood flow into the area so it can instigate healing\n2) apply a topical salve. Calendula based therapies are particularly indicated for indolent wounds like that one. Since you're in Jolly Old England, you probably have access to fresh herbs and can make a poultice, to help warm the wound, draw out infection and invigorate circulation. \nPoultices are prepared from a moist mass of dried or chopped fresh herbs. First, make sure the herbs aren't dirty. If they are, wash them off like you would salad greens before making them into your poultice. Common plants besides Calendula that might help include chamomile, yarrow, comfrey, or plantain. Many of these are probably growing near your house. To make the poultice, moisten a wad of the chopped up herbs with warm water to form a thick paste; place on a sterile gauze pad and apply directly over the wound. Apply athletic tape or Vet Wrap to secure the poultice in place, not too tightly. Try to keep the poultice in place for at least an hour. \nThose two strategies should help.

There's only one other thing I've found for this situation, and it's for severely affected dogs, which yours seems to be, so hopefully it will work. \n\nIt's actually a combination of two things I'm recommending - Subdue Liver Fire, and Settle the Yang, both from Kan Essentials. Neither has any fermented or carbohydrate-based products in them. Subdue Liver Fire drains Damp Heat, which is the usual cause of yeast infections. Settle the Yang does just that - moves excess Yang internally from the head into the body interior. As that happens, the risk of seizures subsides.\n\nTechnically, Halscion should do that for you, but if your dog is Damp (which is rare on a real food diet, but can happen), then it won't help. I'd take a break from both Cessorex and Halscion, though keep them around in case we need them later. Instead, rely on these two Kan formulas to address both the ears as well as the neurological symptoms and the signs of inflammation appearing on the dorsum.\n\nAs things improve, if the stool becomes loose, then we can downgrade the Subdue Liver Fire to probably Four Marvels. Maybe order it in anticipation of having to use it. Eventually, some digestive support will be needed to help conquer the vulnerability to food allergies. Four Marvels has a type of anti-inflammatory starch in it, called Chinese Pearl Barley (Yi Yi Ren). Allergies to that are pretty much non-existent, but I'm letting you know just in case.\n\nLet us know how things go. Cases like yours are so much easier to assess and treat in person. If you don't have a holistic vet handy, it would be wise to seek someone out locally who can lay hands on your dog. Since Chinese medicine derives so much from the physical exam, it makes it much easier to render effective treatment when the animal is right in front of us."

        "answer": "DeVismes Sharp, the cornea is entirely reliant on the quality of the tears to keep it healthy, so if tear production drops or its quality declines, ulcers can start to manifest. \nFrom a Chinese medical perspective, reduced tear production is one manifestation of a general tendency to dryness of the periphery, what Chinese medicine calls Blood or Yin deficiency. \nThis idea is not just Chinese medical hocus pocus. Beginning several decades ago, veterinarians realized that if they prepared eye drops from a dog's own serum (i.e., their blood), it could heal the cornea. Perhaps talk to your vet about that. Meanwhile, though, there are Chinese herbs that can help. All of those with a reputation to 'brighten the eyes' are Yin tonics.\nWhen they don't work, though, it may not just be an issue of too little blood flowing through the peripheral vessels, but also the immune system, if it's damaging the tear gland. We call this KCS, and it is a famous cause of a chronic tendency to ulcers. We need a formula that doesn't just boost circulation but also controls the immune system to help.\nThe good news is that, whichever of these is the problem - simple Yin/Blood deficiency or an overactive immune system - Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) may well help. It contains Blood and Yin tonics, and it normalizes the immune system, particularly in real food fed dogs, allowing the tear gland to heal. It's a good first thing to try for your dog. If you try it and it helps, circle back to let us know, as corneal ulcers and tear issues are common problems!"

        "answer": "Grace Kelly, even though the SARDS is a done deal at this point, the correct treatment for anxiety is something that would theoretically treat SARDS as well, so we need to keep that diagnosis in mind. Your post, even though about anxiety, is thus useful for those people whose dogs have SARDS that is not as far along. The incontinence and its improvement on Restore Restraint also holds a clue as to what is likely to work for the anxiety. In other words, the correct treatment is one that addresses not only your dog's present, but also their past, and ideally their future!\nWith that in mind, although there are a lot of possibilities to help anxiety, the two things together that I would add to what you're doing are both Kan products: Glehnia and Rehmannia Combination, and Calm Repose. G&R addresses Blood and Yin deficiency, which play a key role in anxiety. The ancient classics of Chinese medicine reported that people with Liver Blood deficiency \"felt small\". In dogs, that translates to anxiety and sometimes a vigorous Napoleon Complex in compensation!\nThe other deficiency in which Fear is known to arise in Chinese medicine is of the Kidney. The Kidneys are believed in Chinese physiology to act somewhat like an oil lamp. The flame provides the power or Qi that runs the body, but only if there is sufficient oil or Yin. Both conditions - Liver Blood deficiency and Kidney Qi deficiency - become activated in the mornings, and are improving starting in the late morning as the day progresses.\nHow could these diagnoses also contribute to SARDS? SARDS behaves like a degenerative disorder - in other words, the retina is damaged from too little Blood and Yin. Too little Yin also means less restraint of Yang energy (which is the other universal force resident within the body). When Yang rises because of a lack of the enfolding embrace of Yin, it creates a tendency to hypertension. \nHow about the incontinence? The variety responsive to Restore Restraint likewise arises because the Heart (a Yang organ) is not engaged with the Kidney (a Yin organ). There is too little Yin to attract the Yang of the Heart, and the animal becomes unaware of the need to urinate. Restore Restraint helps re-engage those two organs.\nWhat's needed, then, to help your dog is (1) a Blood and Yin tonic like Glehnia and Rehmannia; and (2) a formula that helps harness, descend and internalize Yang that is ascending because of a lack of Yin. That formula is Calm Repose. One of my colleagues now routinely prescribes Calm Repose to dogs as a means of calming them down so they aren't stressed out when the come to his clinic.\nBased on all that, I'd give this duo a try. There are other options, and sometimes the chances of my advice working vary inversely with how long my answer to the post is! 😂 Still, despite that risk, it's the first thing I'd try. \nStart each formula one at a time, and work your way up with each to a dose that is two to three times what is shown on the label. If you need help sourcing those formulas, friend of our group Aleksandra Topic will help you out, if you follow her instructions here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nLet us know how things go!

I don't really see the need to jump right into giving your dog thyroid hormone as a way of dealing with their low red blood cell count. The real food diet you've instituted should help take care of that, as long as 2/3 of what is in the dish is meat.\nI'm also thinking that before you try thyroid hormone, you get a hold of some Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials. In addition to boosting appetite and helping with the low-tending red blood cell counts (but NOT actual anemia), it helps your dog's adrenals. The low tending Na:K ratio tells us your dog's adrenals are fatigued. The adaptogenic herbs in Lift the Qi should help the adrenal glands recover, boosting your dog's sense of well being and their appetite.\nAnother thing the formula will do is boost liver circulation. When liver circulation increases, more thyroid hormone is activated. That may be all that is needed for the T4 levels to come up and the TSH to come down. Note, though, that since the TSH is still in the normal range, your dog is not rampantly hypothyroid. TSH is a measure of how MUCH your dog wants increased T4. His high normal TSH says \"yes, I could use some more T4, but I'm not that concerned yet\". By normalizing the rest of your dog's body chemistry with the herbs and by feeding a real food diet that has ample protein, you may well take care of the thyroid issue in the process"

I'm sorry it took me a while to get to your post, but hopefully you have figured this out for yourself and given it a try. \nIn Chinese medicine, the correct diagnosis for a patient is the one that fits both their past and their present. It's like a bedrock that outcrops periodically, first as Anaplasmosis, then as very high liver enzymes, and now most recently his hind limb pain. The presence of these other conditions makes it much more likely that Voltrex will work, since they stem from the same bedrock that Voltrex treats, namely Shao Yang disharmony.\nHopefully you see him improve quickly. If he does, his liver should also improve at the same time."

We've talked a LOT about how to do that in this group, and I have a new video on YouTube on the subject as well (on the Ask Dr. Steve channel). Check it out if you're not clear what the best approach is and the logic behind it. \nLastly, if there is a chiropractor in your area, have them check your dog's low back for vertebral fixations.

Dogs love the smell and taste of salted butter, so that may end the objections. Lastly, Gold Standard makes unflavored versions of their formulas if your dog doesn't like the 'ramen' taste the herbs normally come with. \nHopefully this advice helps. When trying to replace Apoquel, we often recommend just reducing the dose of Apoquel until there are 'breakthrough' symptoms, while at the same time you start the herbs. Then, when the breakthrough symptoms improve, try lowering the Apoquel dose again until new symptoms appear. Once the herbs have resolved those, then you can cut the dose yet again. This 'stair step' approach is how I usually replace drugs with herbs."

Hopefully you will get some yet!\nRegarding the treatment of bleeding tumors (such as hemangiosarcoma) with Chinese herbs, although they are the most effective treatments out there, it's important to NEVER stop. I'm not sure what problems you were seeing that caused you to believe that Yunnan Bai Yao was 'stagnating his blood' but since it's loaded with Blood movers, there must be some other explanation. \nIn general, there has to be a big and enduring issue to justify stopping herbs that appear effective for a cancer case, because herbs don't work like conventional treatments. \nDrugs and radiation amount to high dose bludgeoning of tumors and dogs alike with single agents, hoping the dog survives better than the tumor does. \nIn contrast, herbs don't contain large doses of anything. They combat cancer using the 'death from a thousand cuts' approach, where dozens of compounds in meager doses hinder various pathways to create a cumulative effect of stymieing a tumor. This is why herbs are often not toxic - there is not enough of any one compound for them to ever be toxic. \nUnfortunately, it also means that in the near term, herbal medicine is not curative in cancer even as it seems to be clearly beneficial. Instead, herbs hold the tumors in suspended animation until sometimes something else can take the tumor out, like preprogrammed cell death (which is often much delayed in cancer cells). That means that every day, a tumor managed with herbs (and a real food diet) has to wake up in the same herbal bath it went to bed in. If we take away those dozens of compounds then the tumor comes out of suspended animation and begins to grow again, if it wasn't killed by some other means.\nFor Buster, then, I would re-start everything that was helping him before. If there were definite real issues (and not just theoretical ones) with the protocol, then you'll need the help of someone to figure out what to use in their place. Under no circumstances though going forward should you just stop using an anti-cancer formula until nothing has been happening for several years. And even then.....\nHopefully reinstating the formulas gets Buster back on his feet. Know, however, that you did extremely well (better than conventional therapy ever accomplishes) to get Buster through another year of comfort if he really is walking around with hemangiosarcoma"

I'm so glad her hip issues healed up on Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) and Voltrex. To resolve the lingering lameness, I'm wondering if you need to find a local chiropractor. About all I can really see in those X-rays is some bony bridging between the last lumbar and the sacrum. that can cause the last lumbar vertebrae to be prone to fixating in the wrong place, pinching the sciatic nerve. Since it is Gabapentin that is helping and since it excels in addressing pain from nerve root impingement, this theory seems likely.\nIn theory, continued Lumbrex use should eventually make the spine supple enough that adjustments are needed less often, but for now, this is the 'first tree I would bark up'. \nIf you see someone and they can't find any issue with the last lumbar and also the sacro-iliac joints, then try instituting some Quick River from Kan Essentials. It's a good formula to finish polishing off recovering from hip and knee ligament injuries, once the foundation for healing has been established by Lumbrex and Voltrex.

Thank you for taking the time to let us know what happened!\nIf he is now basically symptom-free, rather than cutting him off cold turkey because he is turning his nose up at the herbs, there are some things you can try. \nFirst, you can find gel caps and devices for filling them online. Gold Standard polled this group a year or two ago to see if there was any interest in gel cap versions and was greeted with a resounding 'no'. The comment was that if people want to use gel caps, they are easy to make yourself. One device that makes about 60 at a time in ten minutes work is made by Cap M Quik (https://capmquikhome.com/shop)\nFor my own dogs, I'm too lazy to do that, so I mix it in whatever I have that is delectable. If I have some meaty broth on hand, I shake the dose up in a small amount of that and drizzle it into their food. I also find mixing the dose into a small blob of salted butter makes the herbs irresistible. Then you just smear the herb-butter blob into the middle of their food with the butter knife. \nAnother option is to use a different version of Halscion. There are unflavoured versions at the Gold Standard website if you've been using the flavoured one, and vice versa.\nHopefully one of those techniques works. Try reducing the dose as you implement it. If there are no issues on half doses after a couple of weeks, try reducing it again for another couple of weeks. If still no issues, then you can stop. \nSince strokes seem to have a seasonal propensity, beginning a month before when this last one occurred, start using Halscion again, stopping late January or early February if there is no incident. It may help prevent recurrence.\nThanks again for the feedback. Continued good luck with handsome Cody!"

If those herbs are clearly helping, then proceed. Otherwise, if the tumor is growing in spite of them, you may need to roll the dice and commit to one of the above protocols (depending on tumor type). More is better in cancer AS LONG AS everything is useful to that particular tumor. Otherwise, if a product is being used just in case it might help, and not because it definitely has helped in the past, then it presents a distraction to the body (given that it must be processed) and meanwhile may undermine the impact of something that is useful. Please keep that in mind when talking to your practitioner.\nNote that vets using Jing Tang often don't use other companies' herbs for some reason, but if they are willing, they can source the above at www.atimetohealherbs.com Because they only sell to vets, I'm hoping the person who is helping you is the exception to the rule!\nGood luck, Yvette.

It takes 4 to 6 months for the medial buttress to go away along with the lameness episodes, signaling the joint is healed to the body's satisfaction. Chiropractic and physiotherapy are worthwhile additions as well. You can hear more about it in this new video on healing cruciates that I did with Dr. Judy Morgan: https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438\nGood luck and hopefully after 4 months you've seen substantial improvements!"

That is super helpful feedback!\nMaybe use the Voltrex until the Lumbrex shows up, then add that in. If she continues to improve and the lameness is fully resolved, try stopping the Voltrex first, and then the Lumbrex if you wish. In theory, Lumbrex can help prevent dogs from getting injured, though, so if you have a wild one on your hands, you may want to continue it at a low dose!\nThanks again for sharing, Suki.

        "answer": "Tricia JoElle, if your dog is acting happy and comfortable, then don't stress yourself unduly. For mucocoeles, the two most effective formulas are Four Marvels (especially if they are a kibble fed dog) and Harmonize the Qi (Minor Bupleurum). If your dog is now on real food, then I would persist with the latter as well as the Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood to help eliminate the risk of anal gland tumor recurrence. \nWhile those formulas help prevent and address mucocoeles, they may need some help to clear sludge. You generally need to use for a LONG period something choleretic - that is, a herb that produces abundant thin bile fluid, to help flush out the gall bladder and dissolve what's in there. Probably the easiest thing to get a hold of and implement is Dandelion (the herb portion, not the root). Note that it can take several months to achieve a benefit. Many other western herbs for the liver likewise have this choleretic effect if you want to use one of those instead. The reason why I like Dandelion is because it dilates the sphincter of Oddi, the entry way from the bile duct into the small intestine. That makes it easier for thick sludge to drain out.\nLastly, regarding the little lesions in the liver, they are almost invariably benign in an otherwise healthy happy dog. If the anal gland tumor was not completely removed, it wouldn't be spreading through the bloodstream but would be locally invading lymph nodes in the caudal abdomen and pelvis. The ultrasound saw no sign of that.\nHopefully this advice is helpful and brings some relief!"

It should be uneventful, but will help ensure your dog has maximum strength (and thus the ability to stabilize the injured knee) in his back legs. \nWhen checking them out, hopefully they show up in this database: https://www.animalchiropractic.org/find-a-doctor/ Then you will know they are certified. Note that I do not show up there, but learned human chiropractic and simply transposed that education of mine to animals.\nAssuming you're satisfied with their credentials, the goal would be to take pressure off all femoral and sciatic nerve roots, so that signal transmission is unfettered. That means at a minimum you should have the chiropractor evaluate from the caudal thoracics down through the lumbars to the sacro-iliac joints. They will hopefully employ not just static palpation but motion palpation to be more sure of completely identifying and successfully addressing fixations. \nThey should also check the cervical vertebrae, particularly the atlas bone right behind the skull, since it is reflexively tied to the sacro-iliac and caudal lumbar region. Fixations in the latter may thus not fully release until atlas (and even jaw) fixations are likewise addressed. \nIf you want, you can lay all these out as expectations, but hopefully they don't need to be told what to do. Maybe to be polite, just say it's your understanding that issues could be in these locations, and would they please check for and address them.\nMany veterinary chiropractors prefer to use their hands to manually adjust animals, which is fine, but Activators are more precise and can make sure absolutely everything is freely moving with no chance at all of injury, though some dogs don't like the clicking noise. Bonus points if your vet is willing to use one.\nLet us know how things go! I'm sure others are curious about what it's like to go to a veterinary chiropractor, since I mention them a lot!"

        "answer": "Dorothy A Turso-Greenberg, you need to find another way to treat the pemphigus. Fortunately, it turns out most dogs do not need their immune systems bludgeoned to get rid of it.\nWhen I was in naturopathic medical college in Portland, my thesis was on healing pemphigus foliaceous using herbs. The first step is to move your dog onto a real food diet and to stop canned and kibble diets. These diets are 'heating' from a Chinese medical perspective, with extreme inflammation of the face being a sign of extreme Heat build up. Raw diets are extremely cooling and can help counter that extreme Heat, but a home cooked diet is still way less heating than a factory made one.\nIn addition, I use the western herbal combination known as Hoxsey Formula. There are several companies that make a version. I use the one sold to vets from www.atimetohealherbs.com but if you don't have a vet supporting you, see what you can find online. The key is to use a version rich in Oregon Grape, because of it's strong anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial (i.e., Cooling) properties. If you can't find it, you can try Subdue Liver Fire from Kan Essentials, but Hoxsey is likely preferable.\nAs well as controlling inflammation, the formula strongly detoxifies. Chronic liver inflammation from toxicity results in liver cell damage. When those cells rupture, the immune system makes an antibody to every component of liver cell it can find. Some of those antibodies cross react with 'desmosomes' that hold skin cells together. When those desmosomes are attacked by the antibodies and the immune system, the result is pemphigus. Because of that, a strong detox action is required, which means a formula with lots of Oregon Grape.\nNow, if you're already feeding a raw diet, your job is simpler. You can just use Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs in tandem with a Kan Essentials product. I'd probably go with Subdue Liver Fire. Use two or three times the label dose of the latter. As well, ensure the diet contains a decent amount of plant material (1/6 to 1/3 by volume) and ensure you're supplementing with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to help settle the immune system down as soon as possible.\nOne of those two strategies should work for you. If you give this a try, let us all know how things are going. The real food diet and herbs should resolve BOTH the pemphigus and the liver issues"

That's great news, especially since the pred is an immune suppressant, and to get rid of the Cryptococcus that is causing, it, your dog needs all the immune system he can get! Since Bupleurum helps the immune system function more efficiently, I would continue it until your dog is cured and off the other antifungal drugs. It should be the last thing you take away.\nOnce he's back to his normal self, consider committing fully to a real food diet. I know I'm in the minority among holistic vets, but I really don't see much of an advantage to dogs' physiologies from feeding partly processed and partly real food. I find my patients have had to fully commit to finally have their diets start working for them and not against them in the fight to treat and prevent disease.\nContinued good luck, Crystal!

        "answer": "Mapi Vigil, good for you for giving that dog a home. I'm sure you can help him a lot. Everything that is going on with him is arising from one issue from a Chinese medical perspective, so one treatment should get everything back on the right track. That issue is Shao Yang disharmony.\nIn Chinese medicine, if you imagine the body as a sphere, Yang moves back and forth from the interior of the sphere to the exterior, and then back again. If you were to slice the sphere in half, you'd see a figurative 'tree ring' between the core and the outer layer. That tree ring is called the Shao Yang. \nWhen the Shao Yang is not functioning properly, Yang gets stuck in one of those two locations. In the outer layer, it can produce CNS disorders like seizures, meningitis, and Sundowners Syndrome. When trapped inside, it can produce heat and inflammation in the GI, leaving dogs prone to ulcers and reflux. When Yang is pent up in the interior, it also passes to the Heart, which in Chinese medicine is the organ of consciousness. Agitation, reactivity, aggression and anxiety all result.\nWhat causes Shao Yang disharmony? In ancient times, they believed it was a pathogen that had penetrated from the surface, was trying to get to the core, and got stuck. The body lacked the oomph to push it back out, but the pathogen lacked the oomph to penetrate to the inner layers. The result was that it lingered, producing symptoms of malaria, babesiosis, Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis. The elevated globulin (or antibody) levels signify that your dog is indeed struggling chronically and gamely to try to expel some sort of pathogen, most recently identified as Ehrlichia.\nTo resolve it, no problem to try antibiotics, but I'm sure you can see that if they don't address Shao Yang disharmony, they won't really solve your dog's problems. \nTo get the globulins, anxiety and Ehrlichia down all in one shot, you need a Shao Yang harmonizer. That formula was invented 2,000 years ago, and is called Minor Bupleurum. Additionally, it would be nice to have some bone marrow stimulating herbs to help normalize blood counts, and herbs that normalize cerebral blood flow to help improve mental processing and reduce reactivity. All of that is available to you in Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434). From a Chinese medical perspective, it will oust the pathogen from your dog's body, while from a biomedical perspective, it will make the immune system much more efficient and productive, getting rid of the wheel-spinning excess that is just jacking up globulin levels. \nWithin a few weeks, everything we've talked about - his mental state, globulins, blood count, and Ehrlichia titer - should all be improving. If you give it a try, let us know how it goes! I'm sure there are others in a similar situation who would love to hear!"

        "answer": "Suzzie Hentze, I suspect that your dog has some sort of issue in the brain that has been exacerbated recently, either by the vaccine, or just because of the time of year. This kind of thing commonly worsens in the fall.\nThe worsening during a bowel movement is also common. As animals bear down to defecate, they hold their breath and contract their abdomens, to give things an extra push. This so-called Valsalva maneuver creates a pressurization of the system, which can cause some issues to get worse, especially neurological disorders. Nerve disorders worsen because the brain and spinal cord are locked inside a bony chamber with no wiggle room. They are thus very vulnerable to increases in pressure (e.g., from bleeding, mass lesions, etc.) because in their bony prisons, there really isn't room for anything else. If something else shows up, it can damage the adjacent nerve tissue and get temporarily even worse during a Valsalva maneuver.\nExactly what the issue is would need an MRI to determine. It could  be anything from a small stroke, to some sort of mass, to an inflammatory lesion. Fortunately, you don't need a definitive diagnosis to start treating the condition. Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs addresses all of the possibilities (stroke, tumors, immune mediated diseases, vestibular neuritis) through it's multifaceted action.\nHopefully this helps you out! It can take a few months for Halscion to resolve a stroke or shrink a tumor, but hopefully you'll see signs of improvement in the first two or three weeks. While you're waiting, try to find a chiropractor, to see if there are any atlas fixations aggravating meningeal and CNS tension and the head tilt."

        "answer": "Louise Gibson, diet is definitely the mainstay of preventing issues, so I'm glad you're feeding a real food diet. As you've probably read, if you go less than 1/6 or so of the diet being plant-based, then dogs can start to become allergic. This is because most allergies in dogs are cell mediated, originating from a disrupted microbiome and a leaky gut. The bacteria that heal the gut and which elaborate the compounds that normalize the immune system all eat plants. If the diet has almost no plants, those bacteria die off, the gut leaks, and the immune system starts to malfunction. \nBased on all that, you will want to make about 1/6 of what is in the dish some mix of beans, vegetables, or even a tiny bit of cooked whole grains. Additionally, add Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to your regimen.\nWhile you're waiting for all that to kick in, Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) is a good choice. It helps heal leaky gut and calm systemic immune excesses, reducing the tendency to allergies. It bolsters local immune responses at epithelial surfaces, though, making it the ultimate immune modulator.\nSometimes the location of immune mediated disease is the eye. When there is immune weakness, persistent conjunctivitis and tear-staining can occur. When there is immune excess, dogs can get KCS. Cessorex will deal with both situations, since it bolsters local responses to infection, but reduces autoimmune and allergic tendencies that are originating at the gut wall. You'll see successes using Cessorex in both types of eye disorders in posts in this group.\nHopefully this helps you out. Just a few small dietary improvements along with Cessorex should promote resolution of the allergies and normal tear production."

I'd stop the Halscion for a bit, because although it is calming and fine to use with Gabapentin and antibiotics, it has herbs in it which can increase blood flow to the pancreas. That is a good strategy to prevent pancreatic inflammation, but once it has occurred, your goal is to decongest the area, which Halscion won't do. Once the attack is overwith, you can resume it if you noticed it helping her sleep.\nFor acute pancreatitis and hepatitis, Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) in the Gold Standard Herbs line tends to work quite well. I'd suggest maybe switching to that to get the liver and pancreatic enzyme levels down again. Hopefully she will feel less painful more quickly and not be so agitated.\nAs for whether the drugs had her sleeping so deeply that they caused incontinence, you'd need to check with the prescriber on that. Adoptrex can help reduce the tendency to urinary incontinence.\nHopefully this helps you out and your dog gets better quickly. I would also suggest a visit to a local chiropractor to make sure there are no vertebral fixations causing persistent pain. When that happens, dogs sometimes don't know what else to do but pace and vocalize. If those services are at all handy, maybe get your dog checked out."

In other words, when you put the existing food in the dish, mentally divvy it up into eighths, so you can get an idea of how much 1/8 of food looks like. Then add that much of the plant material of your choice. Sweet potato is popular with dogs, is high protein, and has a decent amount of moist fiber. See if making that change cuts down on the 'constipation attacks' you've been seeing. Oily foods help as well, so if you're going to give him a bit of yogurt, you might want to make it full fat."

I would continue using it given it seemed to help.\nBesides being an anti-inflammatory, PEA also has been investigated for its ability to increase blood flow in target tissues. That latter effect makes it particularly appropriate in a disc dog that has been managed successfully with Lumbrex, since Lumbrex (in tandem with a real food diet) likewise improves the quality of circulation to the spine, lowering the risk of the connective tissue degenerating there and becoming so brittle that it splits, leading to a disc prolapse.\nWhy would a dog with this problem get worse in winter? Some disc dogs have a temporary exacerbation each winter, almost like clock-work, because the cold weather has a strong influence on blood supply, driving it away from the periphery and out of the spine to the body interior in an effort to improve temperature regulation. Herbs and a healthy diet are sometimes not enough to combat this powerful influence, unless you use a much higher Lumbrex dose during this period. Once your dog looks strong again (as spring starts to manifest) then you can once again seek the lowest required dose.\nAs always, when you see an exacerbation of disc disease, pay a trip to the chiropractor to make sure all vertebral segments are moving properly. It's when the spine seizes up from that lack of blood flow that one or two discs have to do all the bending of the spine, and that's what leads to the disc prolapse. Vets don't often seem to understand that, so they are against chiropractic in chronic disc disease. In reality, it's very important to taking stress off the injured areas and pressure off the spinal cord, as demonstrated by multiple studies in humans."

I'm very glad you figured out what your dog was allergic to. The presence of such a clear food allergy suggests Leaky Gut, for which probiotics should be added. Bifidobacterium repairs the wall and Lactobacillus normalizes the immune system provided there are sufficient carbs in the diet. The difficulties your dog has with maintaining its weight on a real food diet suggests they are mildly 'carb dependent'. 10% of what is in the dish should be a concentrated starch source such as a cooked whole grain.\nEven though you didn't make headyway with Cessorex, this general picture of Leaky Gut plus carb dependency is associated with something called Shao Yang syndrome, which Cessorex attempts to treat. Shao Yang disharmony also causes immune mediated disease (like masticatory myositis) and neural degeneration and inflammation, like of the trigeminal nerve. So, it's not surprising to see your dog present with temporal muscle atrophy, which is caused by both conditions. The question is, which one are you dealing with?\nMasticatory Myositis (which Dr. Karen was essentially referencing) generally hits both sides of the head, so it's not as likely here. The formula we use for it (which also helps allergic Shao Yang dogs) is Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials. You may want to source that and give it a try. If there is lingering inflammation on the tummy, it may help resolve it.\nIf your dog doesn't respond to a double or triple dose of Cool the Blood, then it's likely trigeminal nerve damage. Half of the time, that is due to peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which are dangerous when occurring that high up on the nerve (in the head). They usually respond to pred, which you didn't see.\nThat leaves trigeminal neuritis or neuropathy of unknown origin. The good news is that it is usually non-progressive. The bad news is there is no medical treatment. Nevertheless, some herbs may help, provided they target the Shao Yang.\nFor severe nerve pain and inflammation (causing face rubbing, difficulty chewing, etc.), I use Kan Essentials Bupleurum and Kudzu Clearing Formula. It also helps peripheral nerve sheath tumors, were one actually present.\nIf you're not seeing that, then I would suggest DM Formula from Gold Standard Herbs. It essentially has the Shao Yang treating backbone of Minor Bupleurum, but counters biochemical events in the brain that can foster neural degeneration. People have been using it successfully for other nerve degeneration disorders like myelopathy in pugs and even laryngeal paralysis. Give it a try if the other formulas discussed here don't work or aren't appropriate.\nHopefully this helps you out. Thanks for your message of hope regarding resolving skin issues, and how important it is to persevere and take a patient and logical approach. If you give the advice here a try, once again please circle back and let us know what happened!"

        "answer": "Chris Taylor, congratulations on your new family member. Good for you for adopting this dog. It sounds like after a hard ten months, their ship has finally come in!\nI'm having trouble visualizing exactly what you're seeing as wrong, but at any rate there are some things you can likely do to help get development back on track before any abnormalities solidify into something permanent. \nIf your vets don't have anything to recommend, that's good. That makes the issue more functional. If you were in my practice, I would probably:\n1. evaluate your dog's spine to make sure there are no vertebral fixations causing a roaching of the back or nerve impingement that cause your dog to assume an antalgic posture when sitting (that makes them look funny).\n2. start a real food diet, so that we can be sure circulation is as normal and optimal as possible to the spine, ligaments and joints. I would stop canned and kibble diets for good.\n3. If you want, try a glucosamine supplement of some type. There are a zillion of them. The idea would be to make sure all the building blocks for a healthy joint are circulating in your dog's blood while it is actively growing and repairing itself\n4. If there is any suggestion of hip dysplasia (which should be evaluated using an X-ray, not a blood test, since many genes contribute to it), then I would start with Voltrex from Gold Standard Herbs. It will help heal the ligaments and subside the inflammation, so that your dog can sit comfortably normally.\n5. After Voltrex, or after making sure there is no hip abnormality on X-ray, I would suggest either Lumbrex from Gold Standard Herbs, or else Eucommia and Rehmannia from Kan Essentials. These two will help the joints, spine and back end develop as normally as possible.\nLastly, in addition to chiropractic, see if anyone is doing rehab in your area. Or physiotherapy. They may have a lot more to recommend and a lot more experience with this sort of problem than the average veterinarian. You've got just a few months left to lock in as much in the way of normal bony confirmation as possible, so I would go all out this spring, to set your dog up for a lifetime of comfort.\nMeanwhile, congratulations again to you and them. I'm sure you will make each other very happy!"

        "answer": "Jeni Whyte Cherry, I would suggest trying to find a holistically oriented vet to help you, as there is likely a lot you can do to help your dog, even with these established conditions of a tendency to diabetes and the Cushing's. Both of those diseases are influenced heavily by diet. In my experience, probably over 75% of Cushing's cases are diet-induced, and when you change the diet to address it, you will also be changing the metabolism of your dog in such a way that it will be less prone to diabetes. So, why the expert supervision? It may not be strictly necessary, but if your dog is at all unstable, you'd want a veterinarian on hand that understands and supports what you're doing. Based on the Hills you're feeding now, it doesn't seem your current vet would offer that support, but I guess you could always ask!\nTo help convince you (and your vet?) of the merits of a real food meat-and-vegetable diet, have a look at this video series on Cushing's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWkMy26EfWM&list=PLaEeDeV7_crJ_IKcM7J0XQ7wj9sZhEdg4 If you follow its advice, you'll end up with a diet that will also help control blood sugar and lessen the need for diabetic drugs. The herbs advocated in there may help, too, although if the gabapentin is being used for disc disease tendencies, your dog may need something else for that. Again, a holistic vet could help manage that for you in other ways, for example using chiropractic, acupuncture, or even some additional herbs.\nHopefully you give this a try, Jeni. I think there is a tremendous amount you can do for your pup"

If the rest of the diet is 'real food' instead of canned or kibble, and is not too high in fat, then some coconut oil will not be an issue. If, instead, your dog is fed a processed diet, then that facilitates the smouldering inflammation that is the hallmark of any dog with pancreatitis, even when they are not manifesting it clinically. In that case, a hit of something fatty or sugary may be the spark that causes the pancreas to erupt. \nBottom line, then: one or two licks of any of the above is unlikely to be problematic. But if you want your dog to consume substantial amounts of goat's milk, say, then make sure the entire diet is a low fat meat-and-vegetable one.

        "answer": "Eric Richardson, I have a few thoughts for you. First, it's likely important to ensure Abbey doesn't have a bladder infection contributing to her incontinence and inappropriate urination. You mentioned having done a lot of tests, so hopefully that included a urinalysis or two, but if not, you should request one.\nSecond, whenever there is a lot of dysfunction in a limb, it forces dogs to carry themselves abnormally. When that is protracted over years, that can lead to chiropractic issues, which then cause further mobility issues, and a vicious cycle ensues. A chiropractic treatment can help a lot of stiff old dogs gain a lot of mobility back and help interrupt that vicious cycle.\nNow, regarding her loss of appetite, the nocturnal restlessness, and the cognitive decline (manifesting as trying to get out the wrong side of the door), there are several possible explanations, but one theory that can explain everything is if your dog is experiencing a temporary separation of Yang and Yin, leading to Qi deficiency. \nIn Chinese medicine, Yang is heat, dryness, power and force, while Yin is cool, moisture, quietude and receptiveness. We all need both in roughly equal measure, and this is what is symbolized in the typical black and white Yin Yang symbol. When we are 'balanced', you can't really classify us as having too much or too little of either one. We are nicely blended and come across as very neutral.\nSometimes we can classify an animal as having too much of one and not of the other. Take a chilly, overweight, sleepy hypothyroid dog. They would clearly need some Yang and/or a lot less Yin. Or an agitated, panting, thirsty, heat intolerant dog - they would need either much more Yin or a lot less Yang. In your dog's case, though, they seem to need both. At night, your dog needs to be more Yin. And when it comes to power and mobility, they seem to need more Yang.\nWhen dogs seem to both need and lack Yin and Yang, depending on the time of day, it's because Yin and Yang are pulling apart in the dog. At night, we need to be more Yin so we can rest. Instead, Yang is dominating. This is because it should be blended in with Yin by then. When it's not, we see classic Sundowner Syndrome.\nA formula that you mentioned that addresses this is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs. It both builds up Yin to help balance Yang, and then helps internalize Yang into that Yin in the evenings and at night, to counter restless. It also helps dogs stay asleep and not experience insomnia.\nCould it help with appetite? Yes. When Yin and Yang are finally integrated and not separating, a third element is created, called Qi. It is this Qi that gives us appetite. Six Gentlemen is a Qi tonic, so if you notice it seems to help Abbey, then that confirms our suspicions. Instead of just trying to pour Qi into her body, though, we'd be better off pushing Yang and Yin towards each other, so they integrate, activating her Qi generating mechanism in the process.\nOne thing we can do to facilitate that is to combine Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials with the Halscion. At the same time as Halscion is pushing Yang inwards to nestle it in Yin, we can lift Yin up to help it embrace the internalizing Yang. Lift the Qi essentially does that, and will also help directly support appetite (because of its Qi tonic herbs) even as it is also dealing with the cause of the Qi deficiency (which is Yin and Yang separation). Lastly, Lift the Qi should help stop the incontinence, and bolster your dog's Qi enough that Abbey maybe starts walking better.\nSorry about the long explanation, but hopefully you can follow the logic. Bottom line, Halscion plus Lift the Qi should help a lot of these symptoms vanish. Since these aging symptoms are so common among our member's dogs, we'd love to hear how Abbey does if you give this a try."

In an FHO, the surgeon is counting on ligaments forming that then secure the femur to the hip. If the ability to heal and generate ligaments is poor, recovery is protracted and perhaps not even complete. Since the forte of Voltrex is to heal ligaments, it is an excellent choice.\nOnce you've used Voltrex for a few weeks, add in Lumbrex. Lumbrex can be used to prevent the need for FHO where the head and neck of the femur is slowly degenerating. It does that by increasing circulation to the area. Once Voltrex has resulted in the laying down of new ligamentous connective tissue, Lumbrex can help maximize blood flow through the area, so it finishes developing and healing as soon as possible.\nThe other big reason to use Voltrex is your dog's heart. Voltrex contains Minor Bupleurum, which has herbs in it that stop the dilation of the heart causing it to be misshapen and ineffective as a pump. Improving cardiac function improves leg circulation, and improved leg circulation means a pain-free dog!"

I would suggest trying to catch some of your dog's FIRST morning urine using a ladle, then seal that in a clean container, and take it to the vet soon after you've collected it. If the urine specific gravity (which is standardly included in a urine test) is above 1030, then your dog does not have kidney disease and doesn't need protein restriction. If it's less than 1030, ask for a urine protein:creatinine ratio to be done, to understand how best to support the kidneys. If it is less than 3, the once again protein restriction is not likely to be helpful.\nIf the UPC is over 4, then a normal protein (as opposed to high protein) diet should suffice. Additionally, to normalize the kidneys, I would use Voltrex (as you suggested). If there is a lingering issue of Lyme disease (note the positive titer in your lab work) affecting the kidneys, it will help get rid of it. The recipe for a home made diet that you can download from our Files will give you a normal protein diet.\nIf the UPC is under 3, then you need a Rehmannia based formula to address that. I would suggest Lumbrex, since it will also help reduce the risk of any episodes of patellar luxation while supporting renal blood flow.\nProtein restriction has only been shown to be helpful in advanced kidney disease. Without a urine test, we don't even know if your dog HAS kidney disease."

First, it is a strong anti-cancer formula, and second, it has compounds that help reverse cardiac dilation so the heart can get smaller and the heart can beat more effectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Sublime Joint Formula is an excellent formula for mammary tumors, since it has an affinity for the Stomach channel of Chinese medicine, which is to say the mammary chain. It has many anti-cancer effects which should be exerted there. \n\nLastly, the two formulas can help each other, since in the process of improving cardiac function, better blood flow will be brought to the periphery, which means cancer-killing cells. Sublime Joint will then direct those killer cells to the mammary chain once they arrive. \n\nSo, all in all a good choice for your dog. Maybe you should be a holistic vet! The real food diet will provide a foundation for those herbs to work better than would a kibble diet. Make sure, though, that 1/6 to 1/3 of the food in the diet is plant-based, to support that portion of the microbiome (the carb-fermenters) that in turn normalize the immune system. If your dog hasn't had carbs in a long time, then using a Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium probiotic is called for, to repopulate the gut with the microbes that can then restore your dog's immune system.\n\nHopefully all this actually comes to pass, and your dog gets visibly healthier. Remember that the doses of Kan products should really be at least two or three times what is on the label. Good luck!"

If your dog tends to get stressed when left at the vet for a longer duration visit, it results in the release of cortisol. Cortisol suppresses the immune system, including in the digestive tract, potentially allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Immunity is at its lowest this time of the year, so it didn't take much. In addition. the low dose dex test was a source of cortisol itself, and then stimulated the production of more cortisol, making for a perfect storm of GI immune suppression.\n\nThe clay is fine to use as long as you need it. It binds the toxins of the unwelcome gut bacteria that have taken advantage of your dog's immune system temporarily going off the clock. To actually oust the bad guys, though, I would recommend getting Protect the Middle from Kan Essentials, which is a powerful gut antimicrobial, even as it bolsters immunity and digestive power. It will take out the bad guys and tilt the tables in favour of the good guys.\n\nAdditionally, put some more good guys in there. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are easy to find and have a synergistic effect on regulating the immune system and healing the gut wall.\n\nHopefully this helps you out. If you're concerned your dog has Cushing's, rather than repeatedly testing for it, once this is all over, just put them on a real food diet and add (if necessary) Four Marvels from Kan Essentials. You can find the logic for this approach here on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWkMy26EfWM&t=2s The majority of dogs with suspected Cushing's normalize with this approach."

You can try kaopectate to firm up the stool and absorb the toxins.

If you don't have a source for that, you can obtain it from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nIt also helps bolster the immune system to defeat the overgrowth of bad guy bacteria producing all the noxious fumes. There is a natural decline of immunity in the winter months that would explain why this is all happening now.\nNote, however, that heavily processed foods move through the system much more quickly than 'real food' meat-based diets. For most cats, the ultimate cure for their digestive ills is often to get off of canned and kibble diets and eat flesh. \nI'm confident one or all of the suggestions above will improve your situation. Let us know what you try and how it goes!"

        "answer": "Mel Travis, I'm impressed your cat lets you give it that much medication! It's very unusual for cats to get heart issues, so the cause of the problem here is most likely the tumor, which none of the supplements are really targeting. The Kan products you purchased are both anti-cancer and improve cardiac function, so my personal bias is to make them the centerpieces of your protocol, particularly (for now) the Harmonize the Qi and the Blood's Palace. I would even use their Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood instead of the Blood's Palace, to get a better anti-cancer effect. The two will also help your cat overcome (hopefully) the issues that leave them intolerant of the Cardisure (Pimobendan) in case you end up needing that after all.\nFighting tumors is always easier if you're feeding a real food diet, so if your cat still has an appetite, I would suggest giving that a try. if the appetite is weak, then Lift the Qi will likely help, while helping reduce arrhythmias and enabling the other two Kan products to work better.\nStart with label doses of each of the Kan products and see where that gets you after a few days. If they are well tolerated, try two or even three times the label dose to be more sure of an effect.\nFor now, just add these things in if you can. If there's not enough room, then take away only things that you have not seen a visible improvement from. There is some redundancy among the plethora of products, and they are all more geared to heart disease in general or perhaps even hyperthyroid cardiomyopathy, but not so much tumors. \nUbiquinone, taurine, dandelion and hawthorne all cover a lot of bases. If there is an arrhythmia, the cardiodol makes sense. The Lumbrokinase may hinder clot formation. I would think that those together with the Kan products would form a nucleus that should materially benefit your cat. Continue any of the other items that you sensed produced a clear benefit.\nHopefully this helps you contend with a tough situation and your kitty feels better soon!"

        "answer": "Bonnie Kelly, I'm sorry to hear of your dog's recurrent tendency to GI emergencies. We have a Weimeraner, Rodeo, who used to be prone to the same thing. I'm guessing what worked for us will work for you. \n\nFirst off, the Pro-Pectalin (essentially Kaopectate) is fine to continue as it's not really a drug. It's efficacy when nothing else works tells us that (regardless what the tests said), there is likely a pathogen in the microbiome - likely adherent to the gut wall - that when it is present in enough numbers, elaborates toxins that cause the diarrhea. Pro-pectalin, besides firming up the stool, binds toxins from pathogenic bacteria so they stop doing damage. Our dog Rodeo had the same 'dysbiosis' going on in his own tummy.\n\nAnother tell-tale sign is the need to feed just one type of food. Variations in the diet produce two problems in a dog like yours: (1) they alter the microbiome (apparently in favour of the bad guys) by giving them a more favoured food source; and (2) the battered GI lining can't properly digest food down to where it is viewed by the immune system as innocuous. Instead the weakened brush border enzymes end up producing larger particles and the immune system on the other side of the leaky battered wall gets too good a look at these particles and assumes something so big must be a dangerous microbe. It mounts an immune response just in case, and that damages the wall further.\n\nTo cure your dog of this, we have to bolster the gut wall immunity so he can vanquish the pathogenic foes. We also have to calm down the exuberant immune system and replenish your dog's digestive power. The first formula I usually lean on to do that is Minor Bupleurum, often in the form of Adoptrex from Gold Standard Herbs (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433). It's where we often start with Rodeo, giving it at the same time as the Pro-pectalin. \n\nAfter a few days to a week or two of that, you're ready for phase II, which is to finish pushing pathogenic bacteria off the gut wall and bolstering the immunity on the 'food' side of the gut wall, now that you've calmed down the immune system on the 'dog' side. For this, we use two things. Introduce them one at a time a few days apart, in case his system likes one of them more than the other. The formulas are Protect the Middle, and Lift the Qi, both from Kan Essentials. The former is the antimicrobial and the latter is the immune stimulant. \n\nStart with label doses and then work your way up to two or three times that amount, unless your dog is already starting to be more tolerant of diet change. If you don't have a source for those formulas, you can get them from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\n\nLastly, make sure you're giving good guy bacteria to fill the holes where the bad guys used to live. Start that right away. I use Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Both are important. The Enterococcus in the Pro-Pectalin likely doesn't do a lot in that regard, so find something else. When it comes to probiotics, there are likely a lot of good products out there.\n\nIf your dog is like Rodeo, the above advice should cure him of his woes, and allow you to introduce more variety to his home cooked diet. Let us know how things go. Fingers crossed you see the dawning of a new era in GI stability!"

In my experience, the high potency Arnica and Hypericum coupled with the existing use of herbs like Voltrex should be enough to limit post-op inflammation and the need for a lot of NSAIDs. \n\nOne or two doses of the drug shouldn't hurt in the one or two days following surgery, as long as the injection was well tolerated. After that, handle the situation the way you would in yourself, which I'm guessing is you would probably see if you were still uncomfortable, or could get by without the drug. I'm guessing the herbs and homeopathics will be enough at that point.  \n\nInterestingly, it's been my experience that dental related inflammation and discomfort is much more severe in kibble fed dogs, and less likely to be a big problem in real food fed dogs. I'm guessing given the raw bones that your dog is real-food fed, in which case it's even more likely you won't need all the drugs. And yes, you will need to find a softer way of giving your dog a dental workout. There are many options and I will bet our users will share some here.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm very glad that your dog is walking better on the Voltrex and Lumbrex!"

Examining your dogs after every walk is always the first and best approach, since if a tick is attached less than 24 hours, they don't have time to transmit tick-borne diseases. \n\nIf you'd like to cut down on the number of ticks you might find, there have been several posts about natural products that our group members find work well to prevent ticks. Use the search function and have a look through. Here is one good example with several ideas that proved effective for people: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1584089675488239/\n\nNote that it is often a certain type of dog most prone to tick-borne diseases. These are Shao Yang disharmony dogs. If you have access to a really good holistic vet, they might be able to evaluate your dog and tell you if they have that type of constitution. Any dog with a history of hip dysplasia, cruciate tears, tendencies to bloat, true allergies (even on real food), vestibular disease, or tumors could well be prone to developing symptoms from tick-borne diseases\n\nIf you recognize your dog in that list, then I can understand sweating the notion that you might miss finding a tick, and that you'd like to have a drug to fall back on. I've been fortunate to not have to use these drugs too often, so I turn to my in-house (literally!) expert, Dr. Karen Marsden, for information like this, as she has a higher IQ! She feels that perhaps the least among evils is Vectra 3D. She's seen the least amount of problems with it compared to other products. That said, whatever drugs your dog has tolerated well in the past will likely be tolerated well in the future. Lastly, talk to your vet about the relative toxicity of the drugs they have on their shelf. If they use them a lot, they should be willing and able to address those safety concerns.\n\nHopefully this helps you out! Ticks are always a tough topic yet they seem to be relevant to everyone!"

        "answer": "Michael Sachs, if your dog has normal kidney function in his lab work, then you are not harming his kidneys with a high protein diet. \n\nTo know if the diet even is high protein, you'd have to run it through something like the Animal Diet Formulator (https://animaldietformulator.com/) and see where the protein levels fall. They may even be fine. I think you can sign up for free.\n\nIf it's too cumbersome for you to use the program, then just compare the diet to the one we have for free in the Files in this group (near the top of the list, marked HOME COOKED DIET). If it sounds like the meals for your dogs fit within those parameters, then you should be fine. In other words, the diet would not then be excessively high in protein.\n\nOften in dogs, it's not the protein levels I am concerned about but the absence of plant material. Make sure that about 1/3 to 1/6 of what is in the dish by volume is plant-based. That will help nurture and support a healthy microbiome, which then has the effect of normalizing the immune system and a host of other body functions. If you do find you are lacking in plant material, adding a Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium probiotic is advisable.\n\nI'm glad your dog is doing well on the Vetoryl. It can start to fatigue some dogs (even when their cortisol is normal). At that point, you will need to start finding holistic alternatives to support your dog while you reduce the dose of Vetoryl. For real-food fed dogs, the first thing I try is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs. Keep that in mind!"

That wasn't done here, which is just as well. we don't want the X-rays to make them worse! The visibility of the infrapatellar fat pad shows there is no current inflammation in that knee joint.\nWhen you can't find consensus amongst all those vets, jumping into surgery seems folly. A tear that warrants surgery should be obvious to everyone.\nDrawer signs are notoriously unreliable unless the vet is testing both hind legs and the affected side is dramatically worse. Otherwise, if they just checked the affected side, and saw some movement, that is no proof at all of a ligament tear. Often the other side moves just as much.\nThe main look-alike for a cruciate tear is a sacro-iliac fixation, which could show up as palpable abnormalities in the hip area, since one wing of the ileum is frequently rotated into an abnormal position, changing the muscle tone you feel in the pelvis and hips. If the dog improved with chiropractic, pursue that angle. Sacro-iliac fixations are due to SI joint inflammation. Voltrex treats that as well as partial cruciate tears, so persist with that.\nIf your dog is substantially weight bearing at least at times, then a surgery is likely not needed. Physio and rehab may move things along for you, but hopefully you've seen at least some improvement here and there since January, then you are likely on the right track with conservative therapy. \nLastly, the surest sign of a cruciate tear is a 'medial buttress', which everyone should have checked for (but apparently not?). If you get fourth opinion, ask them to feel for it. If a medial buttress is present, then it's a cruciate. \nIf your dog has a buttress but is currently bearing a lot of weight at times, then surgery is likely not needed AS LONG AS you're willing to follow all the advice in the video: diet change, herbs, maybe some physio or rehab, chiropractic, and giving your dog the tincture of time. After another month or two of that kind of care (assuming this describes your dog) they should look tangibly better, helping you be more sure you're doing the right thing. \nHow do you know your dog is eventually cured? The medial buttress disappears again."

That's great feedback for group members to hear!\nRegarding vitamin D testing, I'm glad you're engaged in that. Low levels of vitamin D seem to be a major risk factor for the development of tumors in dogs. It's rare to see cancer in dogs and not see vitamin D levels low at the same time.\nWhat about high vitamin D levels? Is that an issue? If levels are too high, vitamin D can potentially cause hypercalcemia (blood calcium that is too high, which is a risk to kidney health among other things). In Roscoe's case, if calcium is normal, then you should not worry too much.\nThe trend, though, toward higher vitamin D levels is something that needs to be addressed. Pet food is the usual cause of high vitamin D, especially ones with a lot of liver, eggs or fish oils. Looking at Roscoe's food, I'm going to guess the Raised Right pate should be stopped for a while, given how prominent liver is as an ingredient.\nHow do you lower vitamin D levels? If you're not seeing hypercalcemia, you can just wait for them to come down slowly all by themselves, and I would not let them preclude any necessary dental work. Vitamin D is excreted in the bile, so using a mild choleretic as a supplement could help bring the levels down more quickly. An example might be dandelion (the plant parts, not the roots), which you could just add routinely to his food. You can find dandelion greens in many grocery stores.\nEven making these changes, it can take months for vitamin D levels to drop back down into the normal range. In the absence of hypercalcemia, though, there is no rush! Once you get there, then you can stop giving the dandelion (or whatever else you're using to expedite excretion).\nHopefully this helps you out, Melissa. Thanks for sharing your interesting problem and your feedback on Adotprex as a means to healing Roscoe's pancreas!"

        "answer": "Lindsey Zechar, I'm sorry to hear your dog is suddenly not able to hear! The product you're using is potentially ototoxic due to its content of gentamycin, but for damage to occur, the ear drum would have had to be ruptured, which seems unlikely if your vet didn't see that during the exam; and if you saw no signs of pain, bleeding or a head tilt. Also, unless it would be unlikely that both eardrums would rupture, causing total deafness. For just one perforated eardrum to create the situation, it would imply that your dog was already deaf on the other side.\nYou should definitely alert your vet to this development to see what they have to say. They will likely want to re-examine the ear to: (1) ensure no rupture has occurred; and (2) ensure there is no build up of waxy debris in the horizontal canal, causing a conduction deafness. That is the most common cause of this problem in the human world. Note that sedation may be needed to have a good look all the way to the eardrum on both sides, depending on how calm your dog is. If your dog is on any medications besides the ear drops, ask your vet if they could be toxic. Some NSAIDs can precipitate deafness by causing something called 'salicylism'. Basically we are talking aspirin or pepto-bismol, so not very likely, but this is just an example of one cause of drug-induced deafness.\nIf the exam discloses no perforation and no accumulations or foreign bodies in the ear canal, then the hearing loss is internal. To get hearing to return, I find I have to address any constitutional tendencies to ill health the patient might have, regardless what they are. \nIf your dog doesn't have any issues at all apart from the hearing loss, then the next thing to try is a Kidney tonic. In Chinese medicine, many age-related concerns are considered due to a decline in Kidney function, even if from a western point of view, the kidneys appear fine. The Kidneys are a repository of Qi and Essence, two things that keep us alive and healthy for as long as possible. When these two substances decline, we can see various symptoms including CNS decline (which includes deafness), cognitive dysfunction, bone weakening and malformation, tooth loss, hormonal deficiencies, etc. The formula You Gui Wan (Restore the Right, or Eucommia & Rehmannia from Kan Essentials) is an excellent Kidney tonic for dogs without a lot of inflammatory tendencies. Give it a try if none of the other steps suggested above bear fruit.\nLet us know how things go with your dog. I'm sure people will be interested 'to hear'!"

        "answer": "Rena Dershowitz, it seems like you're doing a lot of right things for your dog, both to heel them up from their CCL surgery, and to prevent future rupture on the opposite side.\nThank you for searching for posts on CCL repair. You've probably noticed that a real food diet is fundamental to healing up ligaments and preventing recurrence of injury. Otherwise, a vascular condition called endothelial dysfunction leads to the gradual breakdown of the ligament, culminating in its rupture. The same condition leads to stiffening of ligaments in the back that result in spondylosis. If you've been feeding the freeze-dried raw diet a while, it may still be too processed for your dog's needs. Give some thought to moving to a real food meat-and-vegetable diet, whether raw or cooked to better assure yourself of no recurrence. To help ensure the microbiome that supports normal joints is in place, I suggest making sure between 1/6 to 1/3 of what you're feeding is plant-based.\nOnce the diet is in place, and you've rounded up some physical therapies to help undo the circulatory issues in the back and joints, the next thing I like to get in place are effective herbal treatments. To get things off to a strong start, I use Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438), which helps resolve any lingering inflammation on the surgery side, and repair any vascular damage in the CCL ligament on the other side. After a few weeks of that, I add in Lumbrex from the same company to help fill the newly repaired vessels with blood, so that both sides get all the nourishment and oxygen they need to heal. Lumbrex from Gold Standard also helps reduce further development of spondylosis deformans, helping keep the spine supple and disease-free.\nLastly, given the history of spondylosis and 'flare ups' referable to his back, consider rolling in chiropractic to all you're doing. Sometimes acute pain in dogs with spondylosis is due to a vertebral fixation, which chiropractic can often immediately remedy. \nRoutine chiropractic also helps reduce any impingement on the sciatic nerve. When a nerve is pinched, the force of contraction in the muscles it feeds can drop by 50%. Weakening of the hind limb muscles around the knee can then make it more unstable and prone to cruciate tears. Keep that in mind for your dog, given their history of back issues from spondylosis.\nHopefully this helps you out, Rena. Keep up the excellent work!"

I'm sorry to hear that now he's in crisis.\nLooking at the blood work, he appears to be experiencing hemolytic anemia (IMHA). The increase in the white blood cells may just be reflective of his bone marrow being in overdrive trying to produce more red blood cells, rather than any active infection. A further work up by your veterinarian should be able to confirm that is what is going on. It seems your vet must suspect that, though, even if they didn't discuss it, since Sulfa drugs can cause hemolytic anemia and they quickly withdrew them upon seeing the blood work. If your dog didn't ingest much of the drug (which sounds like is the case given your description), then the drug is not likely to be the cause.\nUnfortunately, it's frequently unclear what causes the disease, at least from western terms. Sometimes it occurs after vaccination,  but often just seems to come out of nowhere, particularly in the fall and winter months. Some parasites like Ehrlichia or Anaplasmosis can cause the condition, which your vet can run tests to detect. It's common for IMHA to manifest with the vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. It's also common for the dogs to crave ice cold things like snow, the way anemic women will sometimes crave ice chips. \nWhile you're waiting for a further workup, you can start treating the condition with Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436). Although used for cognitive issues, Cushing's and anxiety, it's also my go-to for IMHA, as you'll see from other posts in the group. I often pair it with Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials for a more guaranteed effect at arresting the condition. I would give robust doses if it's going down okay, maybe twice the label dose at least while you play catch up. It often works quickly to reverse the anemia. While the condition may recur on an annual or semi-annual basis, the formulas continue to be able to stop the condition in most dogs. Eventually it stops recurring in most patients treated holistically. The conventional treatment for IMHA is immune suppression, which often does not work that well if at all, making this a challenging condition from a western medical perspective.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go with your dog. Hopefully you can get on top of this condition quickly."

If you have any concerns about side effects from the drug or dose you were given, be sure to reach out to the vet that prescribed it.\nFor myself, my favourite one two punch for cognitive issues where it is showing up as both anxiety and insomnia at 3 to 4 am is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs and Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials. Both formulas are adaptogens, which explains their usefulness in stress and anxiety. Both allow the return of normal sleep patterns. By using both, you're bound to see an improvement and unlikely to see any sort of adverse effects. They are both compatible with the drug, so you could introduce them without making any other changes for now. If you saw improvements beyond what the drug is producing, then the way is clear to gradually seek the lowest required dose of the selegiline and remove the risk of  those side effects you're worried about."

The protective effect of Lumbrex is heightened by feeding a real food diet. \nHopefully Ricky will never again has any issues with pain and disc disease, but if he does, the two formulas will likely help once more!"

        "answer": "Nicole Tougas, sorry for the long wait for this reply to your post. I'm not sure whether you've plunged ahead yet with trying cyclosporine for your dog's gastric and esophageal reflux and regurgitation issues, but if you're still looking for a solution, I have some ideas. \nTheir justification for wanting to try a potentially dangerous drug for your dog (given that they have the MDR1 mutation) is that they believe your dog has immune mediated disease. They looked at the biopsy, saw the abundance of lymphocytes and plasmacytes (which are immune system cells) and concluded the stomach and esophagus are under attack. What we are not taught as veterinarians in general pathology is that MOST unresolved inflammation goes through a phase where these cells can predominate. In other words, in many dogs, these cells merely indicate an inflammatory process that is stuck and not able to be 'actively resolved'. They do not always indicate an immune system attack. Active resolution, by the way, involves an increase and repair of circulation to the stomach and esophageal lining to repair and resolve the damage there.\nIf it really is just run-of-the-mill chronic unresolved inflammation, that makes our job a little easier. While there are precisely zero drugs to promote 'active resolution' of inflammation, it turns out that many herbs act this way. \nOf course, we still have your dog's MDR1 mutation to worry about. Basically this mutation means a compound in your dog's brain is defective and unable to pump potentially toxic compounds (i.e., many drugs) out of neurons, resulting in neurological symptoms like the vestibular syndrome you observed. Herbs can potentially have an impact here, too, but fortunately the list of known issues is short, allowing us to easily avoid them. Still, we should avoid Ginseng and Turmeric for now .\nBased on the above and the way the symptoms produced by the prednisone, I would suggest you try Three Seeds from Kan Essentials. It has carminative herbs that promote both improved circulation to the lining of the GI, yet also normalize peristalsis, or the movement of food down from the esophagus through the stomach and into the intestinal tract. It's one of the main formulas I think of for megaesophagus, which presumably is what your vets are worried will happen if they are talking about the dangers of aspiration pneumonia. \n\nIf it helps even somewhat, then we know your dog is Damp from a Chinese medical perspective. In other words, we know the source of inflammation that started the whole mess is actually the metabolic impact of processed food. Unprocessed (e.g., home cooked) diets are an antidote to that, and from a Chinese medical perspective, counter Dampness provided they are not too high in carbs or fat. \n\nThe first step, then, is to try Three Seeds from Kan Essentials. Some improvements should be seen within a few weeks (assuming there are no nervous system issues), and if so, then diet change is the next thing to try. I have seen dogs cured with just these two steps.\n\nIf your dog is WORSE on Three Seeds so far as GI symptoms are concerned, that is okay. The next thing I would propose trying is Glehnia and Rehmannia. It will generally work where Three Seeds doesn't. I don't think that will be the case, though. Usually these dogs are Damp, and Three Seeds will literally get things moving in the right direction.\n\nHopefully this helps. Let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Juli Deddo, sorry for your long wait. Both mitral valve disease and osteoarthritis count as 'Blood stasis' in Chinese medicine. Osteoarthritis often occurs because the quality of the blood supply through the joints is poor. By improving your dog's cardiac function, we can improve the joints, too. \nThat is especially likely to happen if you use Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood from Kan Essentials. A bit part of its benefits in improving cardiac emptying so the heart can get smaller again come from enhancing peripheral circulation. That, plus it's content of turmeric, would be expected to improve the joint pains, allowing you to start trying to skip giving NSAIDs. In tandem with the physiotherapy and healthy diet, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get off the Metacam entirely, though you may have to give two or three times the label dose.\nAnother blessing of Dispel Stasis is that it works through some of the same mechanisms as Pimobendan, allowing you to get by with a lower dose of the drug. In fact, if you pair that formula with two others from Kan, you may restore appetite and actually shrink the heart enlargement down to where the murmur is barely audible at all. Those two other formulas are Lift the Qi, and Harmonize the Qi. The three work together to give your dog a lot more energy, relieve some joint pain, and help the heart recover.\nIf your dog peps up and you decide to ease down to a lower dose of Pimobendan in a few weeks, keep your vet involved. Have frequent physicals so the vet can confirm the heart is sounding as good as it is now, or even better.\nHopefully this helps you out!"

        "answer": "Hi there, and sorry to hear your pup is struggling with bladder cancer. I'm also sorry about this delayed reply. Hopefully you're still looking for advice, as there are a few things you could try. I would probably do them all at the same time.\nFirst of all, when relying on herbs to address cancer, it's a good general practice to feed a real food diet, not canned or kibble. Fresh food can benefit cancer patients in multiple ways. Cooked is fine if you're not comfortable with raw. There is a recipe in our group's Files, if you don't know where to start.\nThere are multiple causes to bladder cancer. One is rampant inflammation (usually due to so-called Damp Heat). Given your dog has been fairly comfortable over the past year, I'd say they have the other cause, which is Blood stasis. This kind of tumor is most amenable to using NSAIDs. It also is the kind that gets worse in the winter as, from a Chinese medical perspective, Blood and Qi settle into the lower abdomen (near the Bladder) like mercury in the bottom of a thermometer.\nTo combat that kind of situation, I'd suggest using three formulas at once: Dispel Stasis from the Lower Palace; Lift the Qi; and Harmonize the Qi. These are all Kan Essentials formulas. If your vets don't stock those, you can source them from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr I would dose fairly heavily so you can try to catch up on the yearlong head start the tumor has. Work your way up to double or triple what the label says. \nHopefully the Ginseng in those formulas will boost your dog's appetite and counter cachexia a little. If the symptoms start to subside in the next couple of weeks, you'll know you're stabilizing things. Don't forget to introduce the diet, though!"

One thing about tumors - they usually do not cross joints, yet the bone seems involved both above and below the left ankle. That makes something like a bacterial or fungal infection more likely than a tumor. Ask your vet about that possibility, if they have not ruled it out already. \nThose lesions may not even be active, though. In other words, there may be another cause of the lameness. I would see if there is a local chiropractor in your area. Vertebral fixations are a common cause of sudden pain in dogs and cats. Once cats are adjusted, they often improve immediately and for a prolonged period, so there is not much of an investment required to explore this as an alternate explanation of your cat's pain. Veterinarians are not trained to examine cats and dogs for vertebral fixations and they seldom are seen in animal X-rays, so it's safe to say this has not been ruled out yet, even if the conventional exam was very careful.\nHopefully this helps you out, but I'm glad your kitty has been feeling better!"

For me, then, I would try switching to a homemade, commercially cooked or commercial raw diet - one that you're comfortable with that fits your budget. There are now many to choose from, with cooked diets being about as good as raw diets, when compared to the processed alternatives.\nIf you're making your own food (and there is a recipe in our group files for that), you should supplement with a healthy calcium source (such as calcium citrate), some kelp (for iodine, trace nutrients and more calcium), a probiotic (such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) and some omega 3s. If you take that approach, your dog should enjoy longstanding health without giving much else. \nIf and when diseases show up, I prefer to use the fewest number of supplements that target that condition, which usually means using whole herb extracts, since they support recovery through a wide diversity of mechanisms. Other supplements are handy, though, depending on what exactly is going on. Hopefully that day never comes for your dog and there is a good chance it won't if you follow the above general advice from puppyhood."

        "answer": "Lauren Gerni, a 'bronchial pattern' means the walls of the airways are thick enough to see on X-ray, due to chronic airway inflammation. Chronic inflammation is almost invariably due to something called 'endothelial dysfunction', where blood vessels malfunction. They become scanty and narrow, impoverishing the tissue of oxygen and nutrition, and leak both fluid and white blood cells, which then damage the surrounding tissue and keep the inflammatory process going. \nThose last few words are important. Implicit in the report is the idea that if the cause was identified, the problem should stop, but in endothelial dysfunction, regardless of cause, the inflammation keeps going and is self-propagating. So, you're justified to take a few weeks and see if you can solve the problem another way, rather than continuing a quest for a cause, now that the usual ones have been addressed.\nWhen trying to solve the problem yourself, know that the main cause of endothelial dysfunction is not a bacterium or parasite. It's processed food. If you have not yet switched to a fresh food meat-and-vegetable diet, that is job one, as it is likely pivotal to recovery given the absence of improvements thus far.\nChinese medicine often terms endothelial dysfunction as Blood stasis since circulation is so poor through affected areas. Meanwhile, the chest was named the Mansion of Blood, since the blood-suffused heart and lungs were in there along with so many big vessels. Thus, one thing we can consider is the Kan Essentials formula known as Dispel Stasis from the Palace of Blood. From a western point of view, it contains several plants with action against endothelial dysfunction. \nEfficacy of Dispel Stasis... is augmented by something called Harmonize the Qi, which likewise counters endothelial dysfunction. Both formulas are bronchodilators as well. Harmonize the Qi can quell acute inflammation where as both formulas normalize circulation to resolve chronic inflammation. It's thus reasonable to give both formulas a try for a couple of weeks. \nIf your vet doesn't stock those, then you can source them from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr Let us know how things go if you give this a try"

        "answer": "Lena Maratea, as far as I can piece together, while a dog has a lifelong tendency to DM, the problem actually materializes when inflammation and oxidative stress appears and then persists in the spinal cord. That is usually due to an injury that may not otherwise be clinically apparent in a normal dog. When we look at the site of initial damage, it's always the same spot - the thoraco-lumbar junction. In that spot, there is the least amount of space between the bone of the spinal column and the delicate spinal cord. It's easy, in other words, for the cord to get banged up in that spot. Because the cord is so vulnerable to damage there, that's why disc disease likewise shows up there so often.  \nFurthermore, the blood supply is the most compromised in that region of the spinal cord. Since chronic inflammation and oxidative stress is directly correlated with how bad the blood supply is, the T-L region becomes ground zero for cord damage, inflammation, and secondary DM. A mild cord injury can normally be repaired in a normal dogs, maybe not even resulting in a lot of symptoms. In a dog on a processed food diet, though, it is predisposed to bad circulation, chronic inflammation, and thus DM. You're doing everything right on that score it seems, but if your dog is just more anatomically compromised in its blood supply there than on average, then it might still fall prey anyway.\nIf DM were due to some sort of toxin, then I would imagine there might be many places in the spinal cord where the disease would start, but that's not the case. It always starts in the one location, which is why the hind end gets affected first. That's the part of the cord that feeds nerves to the hind limbs. Perhaps because a real food diet is one of our best defenses (but unfortunately not a guarantee) against chronic cord inflammation, and real food diets are more devoid of chemicals and toxins, someone assumed that was how the diet was working. But in all my research, DM appears to be due to unresolved trauma, not toxicity, so I wouldn't expect a hair analysis to be very high yield. \nI always say, though, that all information is good information. The trick is that tests are only useful if you know what you're going to do based on the results. Keep us posted if you go down that path. Otherwise, I would suggest high intensity laser, gentle chiropractic and massage, DM Formula, continued feeding of real food, and rehab therapies like the use of a treadmill are more likely to help your dog out."

        "answer": "Jodi Gorgas, holistic medicine would hold that your dog doesn't have two issues - seizures and allergies - that each need a separate diet, where the diet for one aggravates the others. Instead, Chinese medicine (as an example) would say your dog has one basic issue causing both complaints, and that if you treat that one problem, the seizures and allergies should go away.\nWhen a dog is on a raw diet and gets chronic skin problems, we know they likely have a dysbiosis and an associated leaky gut. Leaky gut and dysbiosis are associated with both neurological problems and immune mediated disease. I hope you have spent enough time researching allergies on this page to realize that; and that you have already made sure the diet is 1/6 to 1/3 plant food, while administering a probiotic containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. \nFrom a Chinese medical perspective, allergies in raw fed dogs almost always come from a Shao Yang disharmony. Yang provides the body with a lot of Heat and force, and moves around over the course of a day, staying in step with what is happening outside. When it's cold, dark and wet, Yang should be nestled in the abdomen. When it's warm and clement outside, Yang moves to the head, back and limbs. \nThere is a figurative gate or funnel that Yang moves through as it completes its daily transit. If that gate is rusty and sticks closed all the time, Yang can get stuck in either location. If it's stuck in the abdomen, then the ventrum of the body can start to get very red and inflamed. If it gets stuck in the head, we can see the development of seizures or vestibular disease.\nSince your dog is showing signs of Yang getting stuck in both locations, we need Minor Bupleurum to oil the hinges of the Shao Yang gate so Yang energy can move freely again. That means using Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs. You could pair that with Halscion from the same company to ramp up the anti-seizure effects and help cool off the abdomen even further. Meanwhile, in addition to the probiotics and plant foods mentioned above, use a protein that you don't think he is as reactive to. The whole ensemble should drift everything to normal. If you need more anti-seizure effects, add Calm Repose from Kan Essentials. You can source that from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nHopefully this helps you out and sorry the wait was so long.

Sometimes that's wrong, but it's worth exploring.\nFrom a Chinese medical point of view, the spinal issues and the chronic nasal complaints represent often represent Wind invasion, where reduced peripheral circulation allows chronic inflammation (the so-called Wind) to become entrenched; and spinal ligaments and discs to slowly degenerate. Occasionally the degeneration in the back can lead to chiropractic fixations, which can show up as sudden pains like Charlie just experienced. A visit to a chiropractor is highly advisable. \nTo help make Charlie's spine more supple to relieve back pains and the risk of future issues, I would suggest Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs. It enhances peripheral circulation and 'expels Wind' so it may actually help with the nasal infection as well. To help ensure that, I would pair it with Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials. If you don't have a source for that, you can obtain it through Aleksandra Topic using instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nUsing Lift the Qi can turbocharge a response to Lumbrex, but I'm suggesting it for another reason as well. If you look at Charlie's photo, you can see his right eye settling into his skull just a bit because of the muscle paralysis. From a Chinese medical perspective, when the eyes protrude, it is due to an excessive rising of Qi and Yang. When the eyes collapse inwards, Yang likewise is collapsing. Using Lift the Qi with Lumbrex helps counteract that sagging of Qi and Yang into the body interior. \nConnecting these three things - the eye paralysis, the nasal discharge, and the back pain - may seem like a stretch, but another holistic tradition has also made the connection, and that is homeopathy. The remedy Causticum treats all three issues - the ptosis of the eye, sciatic nerve pain, and chronic nasal infections and discharges. So, I would use it as well, giving 30C strength two or three times daily for five to seven days. If no improvement, then stop the Causticum, but if the eye (and nose and mobility) seem better to you, then find the lowest required frequency of dosing of Causticum to keep the gravy train running. Maybe even once a day or every other day.\nMeanwhile, also give the Lift the Qi and the Lumbrex. Hopefully there will be an alchemy among all three that help return some of the function to Charlie's eye, while making his back much more comfortable. If you give this a try, let us know how things go!"

I would dose heavily, giving three times the label dose at least, if you're dealing with aggression. Alternatively, ask Sarah if she can source Long Dan Xie Gan Tang (Gentian Combination). I believe she can. If you use the Natural Path version, it is sometimes more reliable at quelling aggression as it is more supportive of Liver Blood from a Chinese perspective.\nPlease be aware that for some aggressive refractory dogs, to avoid personal injury and liability, neutering is necessary and tends to be promptly effective. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that.\nHopefully, you have your dog on a real food diet, since stress responses can be more frequent and extreme due to the metabolic extremes that are facilitated by the feeding of processed diets."

If that does not resolve the leaking, then I would add in Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials, after having ruled out any possibility of the discharge coming from anal gland issues or perineal fistulas. Presumably you've taken that step.\nEPI is often produced by chronic pancreatic inflammation and deprivation of blood flow - both conditions that Adoptrex addresses. Additionally, it contains a formula called Wei Ling Tang that not only helps treat chronic pancreatic inflammation but helps increase brush border enzyme digestive power to help compensate for a weakened pancreas. \nThe response to pumpkin (which feeds good guy bacteria while absorbing bad guy toxins), probiotics and the beef bone suggests that dysbiosis is at least half the problem. Adoptrex helps address that, by supporting the population of the gut wall with good guy bacteria while reducing bowel wall damage and inflammation.\nHopefully it helps you out!

A formula that is very well matched should be effective in subnormal doses but well tolerated in higher than normal doses.\nWhen starting a sensitive dog on a formula, start with low doses, in case it's not a good fit, then slowly increase to normal doses if well tolerated. If the formula is a good fit, it will start working even in low doses. If it's not a good fit, then aggravation of any latent problems in your dog will be minimal.\nHave your holistic vet consider herb-induced problems to actually be symptoms of your dog (since that is a more accurate reflection of the situation). In other words, in herbal medicine, there are no side effects - just clues to what is really going on in the form of symptoms that need to be interpreted and prescribed for at the same time as those of the primary complaint.\nLastly, an entrenched Chinese medical diagnosis (the 'root' of a condition) creates sequelae ('branches' of a condition). Start with the most recent problems first. If they disappear, but new issues arise, this is a positive development. You're working your way to the root by pruning branches, but a new prescription will be called for. Eventually you end up with a short list of problems and just one treatment needed. Perhaps when you see the wheels fall off, this is what is actually is going on, if you see improvements beforehand"

        "answer": "Jenny Case, sorry for the long wait. It sounds a lot like your dog has what we would describe in a human as IBS. If that's the case, there could be a speedy fix to all of this.\nMost small dogs, especially the anxious ones, have a tendency to 'Blood deficiency' from a Chinese medical perspective. Even from a western perspective, their peripheral circulation is often sub-par. That can result in some dogs in things like coat dryness and hair loss, but the periphery of the body also includes the gastrointestinal wall. \nWhen blood flow drops to the GI mucosa, a couple of things happen. Dogs can get gassy, because the muscles in the intestinal wall are more prone to spasticity, or what Chinese medicine calls Qi stagnation. The altered GI movement produces a tendency to pockets of gas, which can get uncomfortable until they are relieved. \nThe drop in blood flow can also weaken the integrity of the wall so it becomes tattered in places. It can also weaken digestive power because many of the digestive enzymes we rely on are actually on the gut wall itself (on the microvilli). \nIf we don't support the wall, we don't support the microvilli, so we don't digest properly. This is basically the problem in gluten sensitivity, except that plain old Blood deficiency is reversible and is not an autoimmune disease. \nThat said, the tattered leaking gut wall can cause the immune system to ramp up and produce a tendency to allergies. One of the signs of that is the acquisition of yet more food intolerances after a few weeks on a new diet. That's about how long the immune system takes to get a good look at incompletely digested food particles, decide they may be some sort of dangerous microbe, and manufacture antibodies against them. Note that dogs who eat their own stool are essentially telling us their digestive power is weak. They seek rotting and half digested things, knowing that they can make more complete use of them than undigested food, since they are already have broken down.\nAssuming all of the above is true, we need a formula with the potential for quelling nausea that:\n- tonifies Liver Blood (to enhance gut wall circulation)\n- relaxes bowel wall spasm and gas\n- bolsters digestive power\nThere are several possibilities, but the one I would reach for first is Happy Wanderer from Kan Essentials. It's available in pill or tablet, and the powdered equivalent from Natural Path is Xiao Yao San (Rambling Ease Powder) in case you're lucky enough to have a holistic vet. If not, you can get the Kan product from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nThe formula should work pretty quickly for you. Or it should be more clear based on the response of your dog to the formula what the next thing to try should be. So I would give it a go and then let us know what happens!"

        "answer": "Candy Gaynor Stewart, sorry about the delayed reply here and sorry as well about your dog's depression. Assuming you're still struggling, there are several things you can try that might help restore appetite and energy. First out of the gate, because it his harmless to try and can work wonderfully in some animals, is homeopathic Ignatia (sold in some countries as Iamara). I'm assuming you have tried this since you have a vet that deals in homeopathic remedies, but if not, it is a grief remedy par excellence for dogs, even those where the loss occurred many months ago. It should have no downside, so run it past your vet to see what they say.\nOtherwise, one story that fits everything you've provided here is adrenal exhaustion. Naturally losing one's partner (even in dogs that don't seem too bonded) can be a source of significant stress. The adrenal glands are supposed to manufacture enough cortisol to allow us to bear up under that kind of stress, but in a dog that was previously Cushingoid, those hormones just may not be available. Usually we need a Ginseng based formula to help restore normal adrenal gland output, energy and appetite, but which one to use? \nI think we should use two. The first is Lift the Qi by Kan Essentials, which we use in almost all cases of adrenal exhaustion. It should also help with a couple of the abnormal liver enzymes. Given the high ALP, platelets, and pancreatic enzymes, I would add a second formula, like Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) or else Harmonize the Qi from Kan Essentials. \nBoth of these last two formulas are variations of Minor Bupleurum. Minor Bupleurum and the formula known as Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (which constitutes Lift the Qi) work extremely well together, to harmonize the flow of Qi, Bood and Yang between the interior and exterior, and between the upper and lower body. Essentially, they restore normal flow. When we don't have flow, we have tension. Sometimes that manifests physically (as pain) and sometimes it manifests mentally (as depression). \nI think there is a high likelihood these two could work for you. If you give them a try, let us know how things go"

Although it's the wrong season for it, they can also rule out hyperthermia and other metabolic conditions like an insulinoma or Addison's.\nIf all that has been 100% ruled out, then two formulas for sure that I lean on for seizures in most dogs (especially Dobies) are Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) and Calm Repose (Kan Essentials) or its Natural Path equivalent, known as Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin (Gastrodia and Uncaria Combination). Those two formulas are compatible with everything you're using.

        "answer": "Rocky Renee, so sorry for your delayed reply! You're doing a lot of things right with your dog, so probably the first thing I would recommend is you increase the dose of Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) for your Rottie, in case he has exacerbated his hip or knee osteoarthritis. Since he has responded well in the past, he is likely to do so again.\nOne thing we know about animals that respond to Voltrex and Cessorex is that they have microbiome issues. The microbiome is likely playing a role in osteoarthritis as well, with research into that topic unfolding. Supporting a healthy microbiome by adding some plant material to the food as well as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium is a good idea. I think Steve's Real Food has the bare minimum I advise - about 15%. It looks like the Vital Essentials might be lacking in plant material altogether, putting him below the limit I personally think 'Voltrex dogs' need. Correcting that can be a simple as mashing a baked sweet potato into the food along with the probiotics.\nLastly, on the assumption it's his knee that is the issue, he may need a bit of 'Blood moving' help. Drugs technically do that, but end up delaying healing. Instead, I recommend something like Quick River from Kan Essentials, so you get the added circulation enhancement and inflammation resolution without setting back the healing process. Aleksandra Topic in our group supplies Kan products if you need them. She has instructions for doing so here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nIf you did resort to NSAIDs because of the long wait and your dog is back to walking well, try to reduce the dose to an 'as needed' basis, so that he gets some days off where he can reactivate his healing mechanisms in his joints and ligaments.\nHopefully this helps you out!

It does so not by acting on cortisol and glucose directly but simply by restoring normally functioning metabolism and and a normal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.\nSince your dog is now no longer ravenously hungry and is now chilly, I would suggest the Cushing's state has resolved and I would cut back on or stop the Four Marvels. What you're looking at now is likely not so much Addison's disease, but just adrenal exhaustion from the adrenals (presumably) being in overdrive for so long. Long standing Cushing's can deplete cortisol levels without the adrenal cortex being damaged like it is in Addisons. The adrenals simply need a little gentle prod to produce cortisol, but not overproduce it. For that I would suggest either Six Gentle Pets (Liu Jun Zi Tang) or Lift the Qi (Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang). Since you're trying different brands out, whichever of these two you try, make absolutely sure it contains Ginseng and not Codonopsis. The latter is something people try to sneak in instead of Ginseng to improve their profit margins, but it basically emasculates the formula in the process. You need versions that contain Korean Ginseng (aka Ren Shen).\nHopefully this helps you out. Sounds like you're half way to curing your dog's adrenal issues!"

The idea behind allergy testing is to then avoid what your dog is allergic to, and call it a day. The problem with that approach is that most allergies stem from a leaky gut. The leaky gut allows the immune system on the 'dog' side of the gut wall to become agitated by an excessive amount of exposure to gut bacteria. Some of the antibodies can cross react with self, producing autoimmune disease. \nEven if that doesn't happen, the systemic immune system goes on high alert because it believes septicemia from a perforated gut could be imminent. It indiscriminately revs up any local immune response so that the whole body is on guard. This includes otherwise innocent small scale reactions like to a pollen, yeast, bacteria, a flea bite. You take your dog to the vet and they see the pollen, yeast, bacteria or flea bite - not the underlying issue. If you seal the gut, the systemic immune system starts to calm down and all of the seeming allergies your dog has begin to subside, taking away any need to avoid specific allergens"

As for the diet, it is best to be species appropriate but (in my view) not devoid of carbohydrate or fiber, since a lack of plant material alters the microbiome of perhaps half of all dogs towards a state of immune dysregulation, possibly compromising their ability to find and kill tumor cells. Animals with tumors responsive to Minor Bupleurum containing formulas like Halscion appear especially vulnerable to microbiome disruptions. I do, however, limit carbs and never make plant material more than 1/3 of the diet in total."

Given the healthy diet and excellent care you're obviously taking, any further prep is not particularly needed when the blood work is squeaky clean. \nA biopsy is needed to make sure that the lump is nothing to worry about. Note that if it is an epulis, it may re-grow because epuli originate from the ligaments holding the tooth in the socket, not just the gum tissue. Still, even though the surgery may not be curative, you'll have confirmation that it's not something else going on.

        "answer": "Jx Saravia Aguilar, vets and their clients often wonder whether herbal formulas can impact the metabolism of anesthetic drugs or whether they can raise the risk of bleeding during a surgical procedure. Speculation that this can happen comes from 'laboratory bench' studies of the pharmacological properties of plants and their components. For example, there is a group of enzymes in the liver collectively called Cytochrome p450 that metabolizes a lot of drugs. Some plants have compounds that  inhibit this enzyme. Does this mean they can delay metabolism of anesthetic drugs?\nOther studies have noted that some plants have compounds that can inhibit platelet aggregation, which is a step in blood clotting. Does this mean that plant can cause bleeding?\nQuick question: if a plant could hinder blood clotting, doesn't that mean it could reduce risk of stroke in some patients? Yet the inherent bias of the veterinary and medical professions is on full display in their answer. Never do you see them advocate those plants to reduce stroke risk. You only see them reading studies like the above and then claiming plants cause risk of bleeding. Herbs can only be bad, never good, in their eyes.\nAll this is somewhat of a moot point. Even if a plant contains a compound that can inhibit platelet aggregation, that's not really the issue. The question is, \"If my dog consumes that in normal doses, is there a risk of bleeding in a surgery?\" That's a very different question than \"does a herb contain compounds that can inhibit platelets\", and when researchers have analyzed whether the myriad of speculated side effects in the literature results in actual problems being seen in clinical practice, the answer almost invariably is 'no'.\nWhy do we not see herbs hinder anesthetic metabolism? Why do we not see them cause bleeding? Consider that the average herb contains about 300 active compounds. In a formula with 5 herbs, that is 1500 compounds, all vying for space in the 1000 mg of, say, a quarter tsp dose. That is less than 1 mg of any compound per 1/4 tsp. Compare that to the 80 mg of the single plant compound known as aspirin that CAN cause bleeding. Why isn't the whole herb extract causing bleeding? It has 80 times too low a dose to cause problems! Or even less. Not to mention that there might be others in those 1500 compounds that mitigate that one adverse effect.\nIf these studies turn out to be almost never clinically relevant, because the doses of the plant compound that could cause a problem are far too low to do it in actuality, then why are these studies even performed. It's because drug companies are always looking for the next big thing - the next single molecule that if you took a whole whack of it, could create a particular physiological impact. The average vet or MD may dismiss the notion that herbs could ever help, but Big Pharma is quietly betting the farm on the opposite.\nMeanwhile, Jx Saravia Aguilar, if you are miraculously still reading my diatribe, the short answer is that your dog is fine to take herbs that help her right up to when she would come off food and water before her procedure. Hopefully, though, the long answer gives you reassurance as to why this is true."

        "answer": "Jean Waze Owen, when you find yourself giving so many supplements, you can probably safely thin the herb by discontinuing anything you're giving that has not made a material dent in the heat intolerance, ravenous appetite and thirst. \nNaturopathic philosophy is that less is more, except in cancer treatment, and your dog clearly doesn't have cancer because they are still here! Pheochromocytomas are notoriously rapid to metastasize without definitive treatment, and the only holistic definitive treatment I have found for them that works to halt the tumor is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436). More on that in a moment.\nWhy is 'less more'? Traditional naturopathic medicine holds that treatments don't have innate power. It's the body's reaction to a treatment that does the work. If you give a whole whack of supplements, then the ability to react to the one or two right things that might be in play is diluted by all the other apparently ineffective things that are in use that the body likewise has to sift through and eliminate. Given that logic, slowly dropping the things that don't do diddly will help ensure that you get maximum bang for your buck from things that help. Whether adding or subtracting supplements, I advise doing so one at a time with changes several days apart, so you can assess whether the supplement really is (or is not) having an impact. Anything that moves the needle can stay. \nIn any condition, there is usually a single supplement or two out there that can do most of the heavy lifting and help resolve most of an animal's supplements. I call these supplements Game Changers. They are usually herbal formulas, since they act on a number of pathways or 'stepping stones' that compose the vicious cycle of chronic disease. Take away even a few key stepping stones, and the whole disease falls apart. \nI find traditional paradigms are better at supplying those formulas, since they didn't just throw everything into a bottle that they thought could treat a DISEASE like we do in modern natural medicine. Instead, they carefully put only what they needed in a bottle to treat the entire constellation of symptoms in a PATIENT. Treating a patient gets rid of their symptoms and thus has to impact the disease process. \nAttempting to treat a DISEASE, though, often doesn't work. We get ideas of what to use in treating a disease from research, but what is statistically significant in a research study often isn't 'patient significant'. It can even worsen their symptoms. All that is to say, if a supplement isn't materially benefiting signs and symptoms that you want to get rid of, it likely isn't helping you to be in the dish. \nFair enough, you say. So what would traditional paradigms say is needed to treat a patient with an adrenal enlargement (many of which are just hyperfunctioning normal tissue and not tumors at all, even when just present on one side)? If they don't respond to Four Marvels and a real food diet (which appears to be the case here) then they are usually arising from Shao Yang disharmony.\nShao Yang disharmony arises when Yang energy gets stuck in either the interior or the exterior of the body, and doesn't move freely. Wherever it's stuck, Heat signs start to amass. If the Yang is trapped in the interior, you can have a ravenous appetite, intense thirst, and chilliness. If the Yang is trapped in the interior, you can have heat intolerance, restlessness, increased thirst and panting.\nNot sure which is your dog? No worries! It's actually both. The Shao Yang is like a rusty gate to your front yard. It's stiff no matter whether you're coming or going. Thus, most Shao Yang dogs have times when Yang is trapped outside and times when it is trapped inside.\nThe basic formula for oiling the hinge of the rusty front gate is Minor Bupleurum, which has various herbs added to it to address particular sets of symptoms (and thus diseases). One of those versions is a two thousand year old formula called Bupleurum, Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell Combination, which is a big part of Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs. When that formula was studied, it was found that the symptom improvements were happening because the formula was normalizing adrenal gland output to reduce hypertension and stress. That same benefit is seen in adrenal tumors as well, which is why it works in pheochromocytoma. It's also an anti-cancer formula so can actually hinder tumor growth, and not just normalize adrenal hormones.\nWow, that took a long time to get to that recommendation of 'give Halscion'. But if it does clearly impact the symptoms you're seeing, then you will have identified your dog's Game Changer, and probably not need a lot else of what you're using. You can begin 'thinning the herd' one by one, and seeing which items actually are helping out. You'd then keep those supplements in play as the 'supporting cast' while Halscion is the star of the show. Anyone who is not visibly helping - well, they should just get off the stage.\nHopefully all this blather helps YOU out! Let us know how things go and whether it was worth the effort to read it!"

All practices should be able to get Distemper Parvo titers done as a first step in deciding whether your dog really needs immunizations. Even a weak positive suggests your dog has lifelong immunity, according to the acknowledged expert in the field of small animal vaccines, Dr. Ron Schultz. You can download from our Files his recommended Vaccine protocol. In a nutshell, once your pets have been thoroughly vaccinated as of 14 or 16 weeks of age, then they don't need vaccination for those diseases again as long as they  maintain a weak positive titer. Checking those titers needs to be done a max of only once every three years. Honestly, once a dog has shown a positive titer to distemper and parvo even ONCE in their life, then Dr. Schultz considers them to be immune for life, and not really need re-vaccination or even titer testing ever again.\nSo, bottom line. Get the titer tests done. If they are even weak positive for distemper and parvo, then the best available evidence says you can be done vaccinating and titering for those diseases you mentioned. Hopefully that's how it all turns out!"

It's surprising that a dog on such a healthy diet who is so active would have some arthritis starting in her spine! What kind of chance do the rest of us have? 😲😉Like you, Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) is my first choice. Chronic arthritis always results from reduced peripheral blood flow from endothelial dysfunction (i.e., basically 'malfunctioning blood vessels'). That, in turn, arises from diets that are too fat and simple carb rich, so make sure your real food recipe is more of the meat-and-vegetable variety to reduce the risk of that as much as possible. Lumbrex counteracts that problem and enhances peripheral blood flow. Fun fact: from a Chinese medical perspective, the most peripheral structure in the body is the spine, so it makes sense that peripheral 'Blood deficiency' should materialize as back problems.\nHopefully it puts a halt to the disease progression so symptoms never materialize. Bony changes on an X-ray can't usually be reversed, but they don't need to be. It's not the bony changes causing issues, so much as the ligamentous stiffening and vascular malfunction that the bony lesions imply. When the herbs reverse that, dogs feel better and no additional lesions form.\nThe last thing I will suggest is that at some point you do the genetic testing for DM. If your dog has both genes for DM, then we know that as soon as there are proprioceptive issues that aren't going away on Lumbrex, it will be time to switch over from Lumbrex to DM Formula from Gold Standard Herbs.\nHopefully that will not be an issue, but if it is, being proactive with spinal health is the most important thing you can do for a young dog at risk for DM, so good for you for being so on-the-ball! Let us know how it all goes!"

Hopefully we can help a little bit.\nOne thing that would help us help you is more specific lab test information. Hopefully they did routine blood work. Even if they didn't find anything wrong, can you upload it? Vets have a habit of ignoring minor changes that are important from a holistic perspective. And where exactly was the 'irritation' they saw in imaging studies? Hopefully there is a report that is much more specific than that which you can supply here\nAs for diuretics, they aren't routinely recommended. Instead the emphasis is on finding the underlying cause of the fluid accumulation. It sounds like they could do some more basic tests to get a lot closer to figuring that out.\nFor example, they should have had a microscopic analysis done of the fluid, to help us understand how it got there, and thus how to get rid of it. What were the results of that testing? Lastly, there is a specific blood test you can do called an 'NT-proBNP' to help absolutely rule out any cardiac disease as a cause. It might be wise to request that.\nFrom a holistic perspective, he for sure has cachexia (given the inappetance and wasting). To combat that, regardless of cause, you should immediately get him started on Six Gentle Pets from Kan Essentials and give him a whopper of a dose (three to five times the label dose) to try to catch up on the situation. Besides directly combating cellular events that lead to cachexia, it will help relieve a lot of the stress from grief that surely must be a factor here if the dogs were close. Six Gentle Pets also 'drains Damp' so can theoretically help with trapped fluid in the upper body, at least from a Chinese medical perspective. If he's not eating, then the liquid version is probably going to be easier to give.\nAlso to help with grief, get a hold of some Iamara (sold in the US as Ignatia) and give him 3 to 5 pellets two or three times a day for the next several days. Hopefully that will help him feel less depressed.\nGet started on the above as the most basic first step, while you press your vets for the other information. Then we should be able to provide more definitive advice. Hopefully he feels a bit better soon!"

If you have access to a holistic vet that can monitor his pulse's response to acupuncture, then that will provide us valuable clues as to how to approach this tumor. They might also have more potent powdered herbs on their shelf (see below for what I recommend). Changing the diet was an important first step, however, so I'm glad you've got that going.\nSince most Dachshunds are Blood deficient from a Chinese medical perspective, we might well be dealing with a Blood stasis tumor. The Chinese medical perspective on Blood is that it is like a river. If the volume of water in the river is too low, it breaks up into stagnant pools. Similarly, if a dog is Blood deficient, they become prone to stagnant Blood, which are visibly evident as mass accumulations.\nThe treatment goal would be to add water to the river and kick the stagnant areas in motion. So, we need a Blood tonifying formula that moves Blood as well. Since the other areas favoured by this tumor are likewise in the upper body (including the lungs and brain), we want those Blood moving herbs to have an affinity for the 'Upper Burner'. \nYou might wonder if 'moving Blood' raises the risk of tumor cell dissemination. In actuality, Blood moving herbs kill tumor cells - they don't relocate them - and they do so by a number of different mechanisms. When the mass shrinks, Chinese medicine assumes that means some of the stagnant Blood has moved away, but in reality it just means cancer cells have been killed.\nThe risk of Blood moving formulas is that, as they increase blood flow in real time, they could cause very inflamed tumors to grow. That is not as much of a risk in slow-growing tumors, which this one appears to be. All the same, if you see tumor mass increasing, then let us know, and seek out local help, too.\nThe formula that moves Blood in the Upper Burner while tonifying Blood is Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood (available as Modified Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang from www.atimetohealherbs.com if your veterinarian is willing to stock it). It contains several anti-cancer compounds which can work through a number of different mechanisms to debilitate a tumor. If you see the tumor continue to remain the same size or even shrink, I encourage you to have the tumor debulked, if you can find a veterinarian who will do so. Clean margins are not as critical in tumors arising from Blood deficiency. It's more important to have fewer tumor cells to deal with, since the actions of the herbs are not then diluted across so many cells.\nTo enhance the efficacy of Blood moving formulas in cancer, we often pair them with Minor Bupleurum. If you need a pill or liquid version of that, use a Kan Essentials formula. If you use their Open the Canals of the Liver, you will get a little extra Turmeric involved, which will help boost anti-cancer effects. If Sam will accept powdered versions, then I would suggest Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438), as powders always carry a bit more of a hit than tablets.\nThose recommendations are how I'd start. There are other options depending on how things go and look, but the odds favour this protocol as the opening shots you should fire. Adding in other anti-cancer supplements like IP-6, mushroom extracts, and garlic (one tiny clove per day for a dog this size) can all help gang up on the tumor and facilitate it's 'death by a thousand cuts' rather than relying on more toxic western agents to hammer at the tumor and hope it dies faster than the healthy cells that surround it.\nLet us know how things go. We're all rooting for you on your mercy mission!"

        "answer": "Debra Lee Baugh, that's great news your dog is doing so much better on the real food diet that you're wondering if you need the Thyro-tabs. Hypothyroidism can be cured if one is very lucky. Hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid gland, which stems from leaky gut, which stems from processed diets and also raw diets devoid of fermentable carbs and soluble fiber. Feeding a meat-and-vegetable diet augmented with probiotics offers the best chance of healing the leaky gut so the autoimmune attack on the the thryoid is shut off. If that happens early enough in the disease process, then enough thyroid gland is left to sustain the dog, and they won't necessarily need levothyroxine, or at least a full dose of it.\nThe other situation where we see hypothyroidism reverse is if your dog has Wilson's Syndrome. In that instance, T4 (which is the circulating form of thyroid hormone) doesn't get converted to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone. Instead, the body senses something is off, and decides to convert T4 to 'reverse T3) which is not metabolically active. The drop in T3 means dogs start to manifest hypothyroidism.\nTo reverse Wilson's Syndrome, you have to fix the underlying issue that the dog was sensing as present. Since diet is at the heart of virtually every pathology afflicting dogs, you may have done that when you cleaned up your dog's diet.\nRather than cutting your dog off 'cold turkey', you could try a reduced dose of Thyro-Tabs and see if your dog felt just as good. If so, you could try reducing it again, stair stepping the dose down very slowly, holding for a few weeks at a time at each level. It wouldn't hurt if two months into the process to check thyroid levels again to see if your dog really was cured from a laboratory test perspective.\nOne possibility is that your dog is not cured, but only needs a much lower dose of thyroid hormone when you're feeding the ideal diet. Be prepared for that outcome, as it's still a win. T\nhere are also herbs that can be used to improve the hypothyroid dog. These are usually 'Blood tonics' which act by increasing thyroid hormone activation in the liver from T4 to T3. A safe one to try is Dang Gui and Peony Support Formula, which you can obtain from Kan Essentials using the instructions provided here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nHopefully this helps you out!"

For Kan products, if you don't know how to source them, you can contact Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nThese days, I also team the formula with Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs and Six Gentle Pets (also from Kan Essentials). Lastly, I move the dog onto a fresh food meat-and-vegetable diet. I don't skip that step as a real food diet appears instrumental in helping herbal approaches work better.\nHopefully you have as much success as I've had with that approach.

I use 30C strength and I would give it twice a day until healing is complete. The homoepathic tends to cut fracture healing time in half, regardless what kind of fracture we are talking about.\n\nAs for arthritis, I would see if Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs helps you out. If after a few weeks it hasn't improved mobility, try adding Lumbrex from the same company. \n\nOne of the two, or both in combination, should help. If you get your dog feeling strong and limber again, see how little Voltrex he needs to maintain those improvements.\n\nLastly, real food meat-and-vegetable diets improve the quality of blood supply to all joints, reducing their tendency to inflammation and helping restore their structures. If you haven't tried real food for your dog, you might be hugely impressed by what it does for her."

Here's an article if you want to read more about it: https://www.ahvma.org/wp-content/uploads/D-mannose-Volume-67-Summer-2022.pdf You'll see there are no hard and fast recommendations for dosing.\n\nOne other suggestion. If your dog is on kibble or canned, try a real food meat-and-vegetable diet, even for a couple of weeks. Processed foods make dogs very prone to inflammation, allowing even mild infections to become a big deal that the body might otherwise deal with on its own, but we hit them with antibiotics because of all the symptoms. Chinese medicine calls these kinds of infections Damp Heat, and they respond rapidly to a lower carb lower fat real food diet. If that is what happens with your dog, then Four Marvels from Kan Essentials is what I would use to 'seal the deal'.\n\nOne of those two approaches should work. Let us know how things go."

The last is important and likely improves outcomes in all tumors when trying to manage them with herbs.\nAs to whether NSAIDs may help, there is a basis in science that they could, but not so much that people can say with any certainty. So it's obviously not THAT big a help. I'd only use it if you want to use herbs but hedge your bets.\nFrom a Chinese medical perspective, NSAIDs are Blood movers, and you're already using a very broad acting Blood mover in the form of Dispel Stasis, aided by Voltrex. The myriad synergistic compounds they contain seem in my experience to be more powerful than using a single molecule pharmaceutical drug.\nRegarding Dispel Stasis, make sure you're giving two or three times the label dose, in order to be more sure of a decent effect. Given everything else you're using, though, I'd say the odds are good these supplements and a real food diet can wipe out the remaining tumor cells in those 'dirty margins'"

If you have a holistic veterinarian helping you, ask them instead about Modified Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (which is the granular equivalent of Dispel Stasis...). That is a better choice in my experience.

        "answer": "Wendy Rene, sorry for your wait, and Happy Belated Halloween!\nThat chronic weight gain in your male is unexpected given:\n- the foods you've been using are reasonably low in carbs and fat, according to the Guaranteed Analyses of both companies\n- you've ruled out hypothyroidism\n- you've ruled out Cushing's\nIf it's been a while, you could check the thyroid again, doing a full T5 panel through Hemopet. Sometimes just checking the T4 is too blunt an instrument to detect thyroid issues, given that it's T3 which is actually the biologically active form of thyroid hormone. Until an iodine molecule is removed from T4, it is relatively inert and doesn't impact body metabolism.\nExercise is another tree you can bark up. If you're lacking time to take them out more, you can see if a local dog walking service can help him get more steps in.\nLastly, you can look at formulas that help reduce body fat deposition, which is associated with insulin resistance. A mild formula that could help is Three Seeds Combination from Kan Essentials. It is especially helpful for insulin resistance in cats, but could help your dog out, too. It also doubles as a GI anti-inflammatory. \nAnother insulin sensitizer to explore instead is Spleen Support from Kan Essentials, if your dog is more on the chilly side. In fact, given the Chinese medical perspective on weight gains, it's probably the place to start.\nFrom a Chinese medical perspective, excess body weight is called Dampness, and Dampness results from incomplete digestion. If the body lacks digestive power, it doesn't have time to completely convert raw materials into the 'good stuff' like Qi, Essence and Blood that then power the body. Instead, it makes an 'also ran' called Damp. Diets that are more easily digested are less Dampening for these dogs, because they can thoroughly break them down. \nOn the first diet, the weakness of digestion (or the Spleen) showed itself as soft stools. On the second diet, which is even harder to digest, it showed itself as the outright accumulation of Damp, in the form of body fat.\nThe solution would seem to be to find a more easily digested but still healthy diet for your dog. He might actually need a freeze-dried diet, but nothing more processed than that, to finally be able to break it all down. Meanwhile, you can add Spleen Support and maybe even digestive enzymes, though I've never been particularly impressed by their efficacy. Any or all of those steps may start to tilt the scale back downwards.\nLet us know how things go, as this is a common complaint of dog owners, despite being mysterious!"

        "answer": "Tamara Mesber Du Pisani, that is a question I get asked a lot. How can I actually prevent a torn ligament or arthritis in my dog? The first thing to do is feed a real food meat-and-vegetable diet if at all possible. \n\nJoints degenerate because of a progressive decline in the quality of circulation called endothelial dysfunction that leaves them predisposed to an excessive and protracted inflammatory response following overexertion or trauma. The main cause of this slow strangulation of the blood supply is diet. It is directly linked to insulin levels and glycemic index. \n\nProcessed foods (i.e., canned and kibble diets) are rapidly absorbed and assimilated, which seems like it should be a positive, but you know what they say about 'too much of a good thing'... When food is rapidly broken down and absorbed, it raises blood sugar quickly and tends to be overconsumed. Chronically high insulin levels result, and that switches on endothelial dysfunction while ramping up oxidative stress, leading to inflammation. Real food diets are much less calorically dense and slow to be broken down, allowing insulin levels to drop while reducing overconsumption and oxidative stress. As a result, endothelial dysfunction is not triggered and inflammation declines.\n\nA second thing you could do is just pre-emptive chiropractic, massage and physiotherapy. By ensuring the spine is moving freely and the limbs are limber, you will help reduce the risk of injury.\n\nFor the third thing, we have to look at how lame dogs get better from a Chinese medical perspective. When we analyze the sequence of formulas that are needed, we realize that the Chinese medical perspective on lameness is one of progressive pathogen penetration. They imagine the body to be a series of concentric spheres. Each of the three Yang layers of the sphere is linked to certain parts of the body, including particular joints and zones on the body surface. When a pathogen pushes its way from the outermost layer to the middle layer, one of the consequences is that the joints associated with the middle layer become inflamed and painful. Those joints are the hips, shoulders, knees, wrists and ankles. To remedy those joints, we have to push the pathogen out of the associated layer. That's how Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) works and also Benefit Hips and Knees from Kan Essentials, if you happen to be using that one. This is why a formula for CCL tears (Voltrex) can also cure Lyme disease. Both are due to invading pathogens as far as Chinese medicine is concerned.\n\nOnce the pathogen is pushed to the outermost layer, it needs a different formula to expel it out of the body; and to then resolve the weakness of peripheral circulation that allowed it to enter in the first place. That's how Lumbrex works.\n\nWhat of so-called Blood moving herbs like Boswelia, Stasis Breaker (a Jing Tang formula) and the like? They work only on the surface level of the body, pushing the pathogens out from where they are blocking superficial blood flow. Since they act only on the surface layer, that's why so many of you have been disappointed in their ability to cure arthritis. By the time the CCL is torn, it is a pathology of the deep layers, not the superficial ones.\n\nAll that brings us to the initial question. How do I prevent lameness in the first place? I bet you can now see that, according to this model, you use something like Lumbrex so that the peripheral circulation is always maximal. With no chinks in the armor, there is no place for a pathogen to sneak in and block circulation and begin its descent to the middle layer. \n\nSorry about the long-winded reply, but I thought you and others would be interested in this logic, since it explains so many of my comments in other posts."

        "answer": "Anousshka Silva, I'm responding to both your posts here, rather than separately. For your dog's cataracts, take a look at this post (and the one that it links to in turn): https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1349323692298173/Hopefully that answers that question for you.\nSome of the declining visual acuity may be related to the overall decline of your dog, at least from a Chinese medical perspective. Their take is that you have to have enough Qi in your upper body to hear and see properly. When Qi is deficient or when it is 'collapsing' (like your dog!), then we may have more blurry vision. The vet looked in the eyes, saw cataracts, and made assumptions. But some of this visual decline may be reversible, to the degree we can get your dog on their feet.\nIf we look at the adverse effects of Telmisartan, they are essentially the list of indications in Classical Chinese Medicine for Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus), sold by Kan Essentials as Lift the Qi. We use that formula for lots of things here at Ask Dr. Steve, but it is essentially a Telmisartan antidote. That is not to say that it will undo the proteinuria reduction (some of which may be due to Rehmannia Eight). But it will help mitigate the weakening effect of the drug. I would also say that if the UPC ratio is now 0.6, you can probably look at a modest dose reduction anyway, since most of the work is done, and what's left may be handled by Rehmannia Eight and Lift the Qi. Maybe confirm Lift the Qi will help, then nudge back the Telmisartan. A month or two later, repeat the UPC ratio and see where you're at. If it's the same or lower, then you're winning and not reliant on the drug.\nWe use Lift the Qi a lot in older dogs, to bolster their strength, give them more stamina and generally power them up. If you can't source it in the UK, look for Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, but make sure it contains Ginseng (Ren Shen), not the cheap 'knock off' know as Codonopsis (or Dang Shen). That version of the formula, while cheaper (or at least more profitable) won't really help your dog out.\nThe last thing to note is that the topical steroid will tend to stop the skin lesion from healing. Lift the Qi might help reverse that (along with Cessorex) but for now, while you're sourcing the former, use the cream only as absolutely necessary to reduce irritation.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go. A lot of people with old tired dogs are probably interested to hear how yours gets on."

After you've figured out a system for dosing him and it's been a week or two, then you can try slowly reducing the lasix dose, say by no more than a quarter. It would be great if, after that week on the lower dose you have your vet listen to his lungs with a stethoscope to make sure they hear no increase in the 'crackles' that are a telltale sign of pulmonary edema. While waiting for the vet visit, if you see an increase in coughing, give more Dandelion for a few days. Say a double dose. If the coughing does not promptly reduce, he is still reliant on whatever dose of lasix you just left, so you will need to bump the dose back up.\nHaving said all that, many owners are successful in transitioning to Dandelion, or at least so cutting the lasix dose that a lot of the excess thirst and urination disappears.\nYou'll have a better chance of success getting off lasix with no repercussions if you are doing other things for the heart. Here is a link to a video (if you haven't seen it) that talks about a lot of other things you can do to stop the worsening of heart disease, and even help the heart recover a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVeFcU0Sxes&list=PLaEeDeV7_crLRGrrqXK0SM_LtQguJ9DBO Chief among them are a real food meat-and-vegetable diet, and also Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434).

Interestingly, many problems calling for Four Marvels come on in June, so that's one more reason to use it in my book.\nI would keep the pred dose where it is for now, and see if you can source Four Marvels quickly, so that you can get going with it before the platelets drop any. If the platelets instead rise and Four Marvels is the only change you've made, you'll know you've found the cure.\nReal food meat-and-vegetable diets  go a long way to improving the future health of the animal that responds to Four Marvels. If you haven't tried those yet, keep them in mind as a way to reduce future vet bills.\nLet us know how things go. If he pops up to normal and you change the diet, you can likely get him off most or all of his immune suppressive medication."

Even a cooked chicken from the grocery store for a couple of weeks may be enough of a break to see the vomiting stop. If so, you know you have the cure in your hands - or kitchen.\nFrom a Chinese medical point of view, processed diets create Dampness in cats, and this is what then causes the vomiting. Spleen Support is an anti-Dampness diet, but it's warming. If your cat has more 'Heat' (i.e., inflammation) in their Stomach, then Three Seeds from Kan Essentials might work for you. It's also a little better at combating the development of serious internal disease down the road from the consumption of processed food, most notably diabetes.

The core of both of these formulas is Minor Bupleurum, which excels at rallying the immune response against the bacterium that causes Lyme; and normalizing the immune response to deal with allergies. Either one of those formulas is thus the first thing I'd try.\nIf the neck does not improve along with everything else, then the next step after that is to add in Lumbrex to see if you can make the spine more supple and amenable to adjustment. If you want a pill version of what Lumbrex does, that is Kan Essentials' Spine Lithe.\nThe Kan pills are not as strong as the Gold Standard granules, but may be easier to give your cat. You can dose your cat according to the table located here: https://nphc.ca/using/dosage\nHopefully these make the difference for your kitty.

        "answer": "Schatze Siegert-Young, I'm answering the questions you sent to Gold Standard Herbs in my response to your post here in Ask Dr. Steve. \nMy understanding of your situation is that 3 months ago your dog started having mucous in his stool, eventually resulting in a standard PCR Canine Diarrhea Panel being done, to look for any DNA associated with any pathogenic organisms. Recently, Idexx (who runs this test) added Circovirus to the list of viruses the test checks for, and your dog came up positive. Now you're panicked, because you can't get much in the way of answers on how to proceed yet you've heard the virus can damage microvilli. You're wondering if that is reversible or if this is a permanent issue.\nAssuming that summary correct, I have some words of advice. First, you're not alone in your confusion. Here are some quotes from specialists about this test:\n- \"Diarrhea PCR panels are easy to run but difficult to interpret\"\n- \"Not a lot known about canine Circovirus, including whether it has even been definitively linked to disease...as long as the dog is responding to treatment, I wouldn't worry.\"\n- \"It's likely irrelevant. There are lots of viruses that are normally found in healthy individuals and it seems like this virus more likely fits into that group than something overly pathogenic\"\nWhile some dogs may be much more sick, it's unclear whether the virus is acting alone to produce those signs. Meanwhile, given the mild symptoms you're seeing and the opinions of these specialists, you can stop worrying about your dog. Note that the virus appears in the stool of perhaps 10 or 20% of normal dogs. In dogs with GI disease, often only 20% of dogs have it. You can see then why specialists are not convinced it's playing a major role in disease, if the same number of healthy dogs as sick test positive for it.\nAs to whether (if the virus is even causing damage) the microvilli can be restored, the answer is yes. Microvilli regenerate within about three days, once virus replication stops as the immune system kicks in. If your dog was sick from the virus, likely they are already healed.\nAll the steps you're planning - a microbiome test, the use of probiotics, the feeding of real fresh food - should help him rapidly recover. If you want to help him further, you can obtain Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials, which will help both the probiotics 'take root' on the microvilli and help protect them; and will bolster the immune response against the virus and any other pathogens. If you don't have a source for Lift the Qi, you can obtain it from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nAs for follow up, I would not recommend retesting, since many normal dogs carry the virus, and since the virus itself is not even clearly a cause of disease. The Lift the Qi should resolve the mucous in the stool, and when all GI signs have disappeared, that will be proof enough your dog is healthy once more."

If your vet is at all holistic, I encourage them to reach out to www.atimetohealherbs.com to get a hold of the trio of herbs I recommend from Natural Path to treat hemangiosarcoma: HSA Compound, Yun Zhi (or Coriolus), and Bilberry. Early indications are that the HSA Compounds works as well or better than conventional treatments for many HSA dogs, offering twice the long term survival. There is a file in our group Files called HSA 10-31-2017 which provide the preliminary results of our clinical studies using the above herbs.\nIf you can't sway your vet to help you (though that article should be convincing enough for them to try), then you should at least institute Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) and Voltrex, two Gold Standard Products. The two formulas contain some of the most important herbs used in the study and will help to hasten recovery from bleeding episodes along with the Yunnan Baiyao that you have on hand.\nI'm not sure particularly what the prednisone and antacid are expected to do in a suspected hemangiosarcoma, and they may perpetuate the bladder infection. If you haven't seen a benefit from them, then consider weaning him off them, so you don't suppress the ability of his immune system to kill tumor cells. If you're trying to stimulate appetite, there is more research support for Six Gentlemen (sold by Kan Essentials as Six Gentlepets) in combating the cachexia of cancer than there is for prednisone. \nHopefully this helps you out so you and your dog can continue to enjoy quality time"

        "answer": "There is a lot to unpack there in that paragraph. For any chronic skin issue, the first thing I recommend people do is change the diet to a real food meat-and-vegetable diet that is not too high in starch. About half of skin (and ear) inflammation cases will promptly improve within just weeks. I bet there are many in this group that can attest to that. Nutritional balance is not critical for the couple of weeks you're trying that experiment out, but I take issue with your vets pronouncement that all home cooked diets are not going to be nutritionally balanced. Achieving the dietary minimums required by AAFCO and the NRC is very easy. The Home Cooked Diet guidelines in the files for this group are an example, and they were formulated by a veterinary nutritionist. \nGiven the above, the diet you've settled on is less than ideal. It is beef-based, which is a notorious allergen in dogs. It is also over 50% carbs, which given that it is baked (and thus processed) make it very pro-inflammatory. If I were you, I'd remove it and just feed more of your chicken and vegetables for the next two weeks, to see if the diet is part of the problem. If the ears are a lot better after that, then I would advise adding Four Marvels from Kan Essentials, which should hasten improvements further. \nIf the ears are no better, not to worry. We know then that your dog has a true allergy driving the infection. That is unlikely, though, given the lack of response to Apoquel. The failure of the drug makes it more likely that diet is the problem and you should start there. Nevertheless, if the diet change has zero impact, then the formula I usually use for dogs with chronic ear infections in that situation is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436). Although designed to treat anxiety, it's one of my favourite formulas for severe obstinate otitis.\nProbiotics are very important for dogs that don't respond to diet change. Ensure that whatever you're giving contains Lactobacillus (to modulate the immune system) and Bifidobacterium (to seal the leaky gut that seems to be at the heart of  most allergies). Ensure the diet is 1/3 to 1/6 vegetables to support those organisms. Otherwise your probiotic will die as soon as it hits the GI.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go! \nIf the"

        "answer": "Brigitte Bard, sorry to hear your pup has kidney issues. Hopefully we can help you out. I'm pleased to see you got a urine protein:creatinine ratio done. For me that is almost the first step, since I use it as a rough guide to how to start supporting the kidneys. \nVeterinarians see kidney issues as a purely degenerative process, but I don't think that is accurate. Based on our treatment successes and then an analysis of why they work, it's become clear to me that there are two states that the kidney waffles between when they are struggling. One is a state of more acute inflammation, though not enough to effect renal shut down, but sufficient to cause significant protein leakage and renal congestion. These cases typically have a UPC of >4.0. The herbs needed to manage this condition are decongesting and anti-inflammatory. They moderate the flow of blood through the kidneys, so they blood supply has a chance to drain.\nIf you can get the inflammation under control, the kidneys fall back into the second state, where their primary issue is just lack of blood flow, nutrients and oxygen. These animals often have a UPC of < 3.0 (like your dog). Different herbs are called for in this state than the inflammatory state. The goal here is to boost renal blood flow, whereas if the kidneys were congested, that would be a bad idea.\nSince the kidneys need two opposite strategies, depending on what state they are in, we need some guidance on where to start for a given animal. The UPC rule is a rough guide, but is not hard and fast, and there are definitely exceptions. To make sure we have implemented the right circulatory effect, we recheck the kidneys after a few weeks to make sure the BUN and creatinine are improving.\nYou might think, \"Why can't I hedge my bets and provide both vascular influences?\". I've tried that and it doesn't work. We have to commit, and hope we've guessed right. In addition, everything we do has to be in alignment with our circulatory goals. If some of the supplements 'giveth' and some of them 'taketh away blood', we won't get anywhere. Your supplements are not all aligned from a circulatory perspective, so we can't use all of them at once (and I'm sure your dog is relieved about that!).\nWith your dog, I'm suggesting we focus on increasing renal blood flow to start with,, followed by a check in a few weeks to see if the BUN and creat are budging. If not, we try the opposite strategy. There is a chance we need to use the anti-inflammatory approach because, although the UPC is quite low, the platelets are increased. Dogs that benefit from the anti-inflammatory (or Shao Yang) approach often have increased platelets.\nTo start with, I would get a hold of Kan Essentials Rehmannia Eight, and also Three Seeds, and use them together. You have one Rehmannia product there (the Dr. Harvey's one), but I find that it's only when it's in a formula that incorporates the wisdom of thousands of years of herbal experience that I actually see Rehmannia doing much. So, the Dr. Harvey's product notwithstanding, get some Rehmannia Eight. Begin with the dose on the label and then move up from there to two or three times the label dose to be more sure of a proper effect. Take the same approach with Three Seeds. If you need to source those, you can do so through Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nProducts you have ordered that are potentially incompatible with this first 'circulatory boosting' approach are the Earth Animal product and the Prana Kidney product.\nIf you don't see success after a few weeks, try the opposite approach to blood flow for a few weeks. That means Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) while continuing Three Seeds. The Prana product is theoretically more helpful here, but it employs a western herbal approach to kidney disease that (while it was the first one I ever tried as a herbalist) I find doesn't really work. The Chinese medical take on managing kidney problems is much more effective in my hands, and that of probably thousands of veterinarians. \nRegarding food, nothing is nutritious if a dog won't eat it, so you have to cater to his whims for now. If you get him eating more consistently, I favour a meat-and-vegetable diet even in most kidney dogs. As soon as they are not in the inflammatory state, the kidneys benefit from normal dietary protein (in my experience) because protein is an important driver of renal blood flow and phosphorus clearance. Only in the inflamed kidney do we need to be very careful of how much protein to deliver in the diet. In those cases, I let the dog make my decisions for me, on the assumption that they will only eat things that make them feel good when they otherwise feel crappy.\nHopefully this gets you going! Good luck and let us know how things evolve. There are probably lots of people with renal failure dogs that would be interested to hear"

Antibiotics may help with that and easily reduce some pain. They might also kill the dog's appetite. So while they are a valid consideration, we need to treat carefully.

I presume you've answered your own question by now, but since you didn't remove your post, I'm answering it just in case. \nA waxing and waning course is common for dogs recovering from cruciate tears. Most tears are partial, and are actually healed under the influence of Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) and a fresh food diet relatively quickly - in just a couple of weeks (though remember to add plant material to your raw - that's not just for allergies). \nIf ligaments heal quickly, why the apparent relapse? It's true that the ligament is healed, but in a very loose-knit fashion. Ligaments acquire strength when this haphazard arrangement of collagen fibers begins to organize and align in certain directions, and they only do that when there is a tension applied to the ligament that is too much for them to bear. Pain and inflammation arises once again, but the ligament is almost invariably still intact. The fiber realignment kicks in, and within several days to a week or two, the dog is now protected against future strain coming from that exact direction. But, there are a lot of directions that tension can be applied from, which means a lot of waxing and waning lameness. Then, just when people wonder if the ligament will ever heal, it stops. All the directions of possible strain are now shored up against, the medial buttress that has been shoring up the knee all this time subsides, and the dog walks normally.\nSo, how do you know if your dog is almost healed? If the medial buttress has largely gone away, the leg is largely healed, even given the latest exacerbation.\nFormulas calling themselves Xiao Huo Luo Tang are all over the map in terms of their ingredients, but they will all be 'Blood movers' which is the only other diagnosis involved with CCL tears sometimes that Voltrex and Lumbrex don't directly address. So, whatever version you're looking at will likely help.\nThe last thing I have to say on this is that some severe exacerbations have nothing to do with the ligament, but are due to a pinched nerve from vertebral fixations. Fixations are more likely in a dog with mobility issues, because they start to adopt antalgic postures. If there is any 'stickiness' to their vertebrae, they can get stuck in these new positions that are not normally adopted by the body. Adjacent muscles clamp down. the nearby nerves are pinched, and lameness abruptly ensues. A local chirorpactor should be able to quickly determine if that occurred. Have them pay careful attention to the S-I joints. Fixations here are a common cause of sudden 3-legged lameness in dogs, due to the 'piriformis syndrome' they cause.\nHopefully this helps you out. Or helps someone else if the issue on your end has since resolved"

Real food diets help stop the microvascular changes that impede liver blood flow and are associated with reduced production of urinary crystals and stones. Most stones have a protein nidus at their center, which is often caused by damage to nephrons from feeding a processed food. There is a post-prandial uptick in the circulation of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6, when dogs are 'overnourished', which the feeding of processed diets facilitates. Since the kidneys are a giant filter, the interleukin 6 lands there and incites an inflammatory response that damages the kidneys, causing protein seeding of the urine. All of that is circumvented by feeding a real food diet.\nAsk for a urinalysis to identify any urinary crystals and thus the type of stone. Based on that, we might have more dietary and supplement recommendations"

        "answer": "Tanya Cashin, I think you're right on the money with your assessment. Although I can't really see the lesions, your description, along with the timing of this latest worsening, suggests your dog has a very superficial pyoderma (which is a ten dollar word for skin infection). \nDry white flaking lesions like that are the hallmark of Blood deficiency, which is the Chinese medical term for reduced circulation of blood to the skin, and elsewhere.\nSince the latest exacerbation occurred once Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434), we can assume in hindsight that skin bacteria (most likely Staph) are taking advantage of the subsequent drop in skin perfusion to set up shop. \nShampoos (e.g., something with tea tree oil in it or chlorhexidine) are likely to help, as well as restoration of Cessorex. Dry Derma Relief is also likely to resolve it. The Chinese name for the classical formula on which it is based is called Si Wu Xiao Feng Yin. I've only seen Natural Path make it in granular form, but maybe you will get lucky. Cool the Blood plus Cessorex may also resolve it.\nLet us know how things go, Tanya. If it persists, a short course of Cephalexin will resolve it if necessary, but hopefully you can address it without drugs. Meanwhile, thanks so much for the succinct question and for taking time to research the site first. It helps us help you!"

That said, at 3 years, physical development is pretty complete, so a spay at this point is unlikely to cause issues. If you want to preserve estrogen levels for some reason (because of concerns about physical development, for example), then you can pursue an ovary-sparing sterilization. Keep in mind, though, your dog would still have heat cycles, with all their attendant issues."

        "answer": "Alba Ruiz, it sounds like there is nerve root impingement creating the arching of the back and neck and any associated spasticity. This can happen from disc disease, which the neurologist may diagnose. Many times, though, it occurs from vertebral fixations - subtle misalignments between vertebrae that then 'lock down' and pinch the nerve that passes between them. Sometimes they release themselves, as apparently happened to your dog last time. Eventually, they need to be manually released by a chiropractor. You also need a chiropractor to detect fixations for you, as veterinarians are not trained that such problems even exist, let alone how to detect them. Generally chiropractic will help address the problem quickly, if that is what is going on.\nWhether disc disease, muscle spasm, or back fixation - all of these problems worsen in mid-winter, when peripheral circulation is at a low ebb, causing ligaments and discs to become more brittle and allowing muscles to spasm more easily. Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs is designed to treat this condition, allowing discs to heal, muscles to relax and vertebrae to start moving properly again. Over time, the need for chiropractic treatments drops with continued use of Lumbrex. \nSometimes for very spastic muscles, an additional relaxant is needed. Drugs are available that can accomplish this. So can the western herb Valerian root (use a human dose in your dog); and so can Liver Support Formula from Kan Essentials.\nI would also recommend a real food diet, since disc degeneration, ligamentous stiffening, spondylosis and vertebral stickiness are all caused by declining spinal circulation, which itself is caused by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is caused from insulin resistance from high glycemic index foods, notably canned or kibble diets. \nReal food diets do not produce insulin resistance, stopping the vascular decline that leads to disc disease and the like. When these diets are used along with Lumbrex, it's very rare for dogs to ever suffer a full relapse of disc disease ever again.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go!"

If you're not seeing a halting of progression:\n- try a higher dose of DM Formula. You can safely double the label dose\n- feed a real fresh food diet, not canned or kibble\n- read this post about laser therapy in DM and look for the article that it mentions in the Files for this group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1725151671382038/\n- connect with Sarah MacKeigan, who runs a dedicated group for DM dogs. She also may be able to share a video presentation I did for her a few years back, explaining what is happening in DM and why the above strategies pose the best chance for stopping progression.

        "answer": "Lena Maratea, they may not be able to change the output on their class III laser. Assuming it has a 500mW output, that means it will deliver about 1 joule per sq cm per two seconds of application to a specific area. Since studies are beginning to show better results with at least 20 J/sq.cm (and up to 50, even)., they would need to apply the laser 40 seconds per spot, which I assume they are not doing. Studies like this one (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32301669/) show that higher energy deliveries are associated with better outcomes - much higher than what vets typically use.\nThere is an excellent scientific basis for what was observed in that study. Lower joule settings produce more nitric oxide in the cord. This is believed to be a positive, and for disc disease it may be. But given what we now know about the pathophysiology of degenerative myelopathy, it can be exactly the wrong thing to do.\nI'm uploading a file separately in another post that can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1725391414691397/ The article is also in the Files for the group, and is called Supporting Spinal Circulation. It explains how nitric oxide promoting herbs and laser settings can actually set dogs back. So, if your vets won't change their approach, and the DM diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing, I would suggest you forego laser, unless you're seeing clear benefits following the treatments. \nIf they do try it, and your dog seems worse, then the low joule settings may be more appropriate - for example if disc disease is currently a bigger issue for your dog and there is no deep cord injury yet. In that case, more power to them (pun not intended) and they should continue what works best. That is the most important thing, though - to be willing to try different approaches to see what works the best for your dog. Hopefully they have that kind of flexibility in their thinking and hopefully the article I provided helps."

        "answer": "Joey Levin, Lyme disease can embed itself in joints to create a chronic osteoarthritis, but whether it's Lyme disease or a CCL tear, my suggestion is the same, which is Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs. It has herbs in their to normalize circulation in the knee to help heal a torn ligament, as well as mitigate joint inflammation. It also has herbs in there that normalize immune function and specifically rally the immune system to help clear embedded infections, including the one that causes Lyme disease.\nAs well, to hasten recovery, it's always wise to feed a real food diet. A lot of the initial degeneration that occurs in the cruciate ligament is diet driven, through a process known as endothelial dysfunction. Feeding a fresh meat-and-vegetable diet stops that process from occurring, helping to preserve the ligament on the other side while healing the current injury.\nLastly, if your dog isn't better on the Voltrex, and your vet is not a chiropractor, try to seek one out. It's easy for conventionally trained vets to miss vertebral fixations that can create pinched nerves and associated pain. The only reason I'm suggesting Voltrex first is because you said he yelped when she  manipulated the knee specifically. If, however, it turns out to be a pinched nerve, then Lumbrex from Gold Standard Herbs is what I would use to address the problem. I also use it in CCL tears, adding it in after about two months on Voltrex. Lumbrex then helps finish healing and seems to prevent recurrence going forward (especially if you've also changed the diet).\nHopefully this helps you out!"

        "answer": "Marie Rucci, protein-losing enteropathy is much more likely if both globulin and albumin levels are low. In your dog's case, only the albumin levels are low. Another cause of that can be Liver Blood deficiency, which is a decline in liver blood flow that can result in the liver not making what it is supposed to, albumin included. Liver Blood deficiency can become aggravated at this time of year (i.e., the winter months), particularly if the herbs used to treat the tumor are very bitter. You should check in with your oncologist to make sure the protocol doesn't need adjusting and to let them know of this development.\n\nA treatment I would suggest you run by them is Natural Path's Xiao Yao San (Rambling Ease Powder), which nourishes Liver Blood (in real time, so that the liver gets the support it needs to manufacture more albumin). It also helps address vomiting and diarrhea, by harmonizing (in Chinese medical terms) the Spleen (which governs digestion and assimilation) with the Liver (which governs bowel motility). In other words, it's an excellent formula to support this kind of problem.\n\nAgain, since you have the luxury of a holistic vet, ask them if they are willing to give that a try, while backing off of any aggressively cooling and drying herbs (which are commonly used to manage very inflammatory tumors like those affecting the bladder).

        "answer": "Hi there! Sorry for the delayed response, but hopefully you researched how we manage chronic skin inflammation in the group and have already implemented some changes. Even if this lesion is diagnosed as due to Leishmaniasis, I would still recommend you:\n- switch all the way over to a fresh food meat-and-vegetable diet (as kibble is definitely pro-inflammatory by comparison to real food)\n- introduce Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs \nThe latter does not just treat allergies, but by normalizing and optimizing immunity, it also helps combat deeply entrenched pathogens like Leishmania. Severe inflammation of the chin is a key note symptom suggesting Cessorex will work for you. \nSomething else to take the edge off is Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials. I would use it at the same time as the Cessorex, and work your way up to double or triple the label dose. If you can't find Cool the Blood, you can source it from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nLastly, make sure your probiotics are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In the event this is just a severe allergy (such as to a plastic bowl), all allergies stem in part from leaky gut, and these two species help heal the gut and also create metabolites that regulate the immune system, helping to resolve allergies in the process.\nHopefully this helps you out!"

I find it essentials for Wobbler's\n2. Gold Bead Implants provide a form of 'perma-acupuncture'. If there is anyone in your area trained in that discipline, I've seen it do great things for Wobbler dogs\n3. There is sometimes an element of muscle spasticity in the neck that aggravates Wobblers. You can combat that using the western herb known as Valerian root; or by giving Bu Gan Tang (by Natural Path - your vet may have it on their shelf). BGT is sold by Kan Essentials as Liver Support Formula. If your vet wants to source it for you, they can find it at www.atimetohealherbs.com. The NP version is stronger than the Kan product so may work better for you, and will help enable the other products to do their best work.\nHope that helps.

It also supports normal gut motility and boosts digestive power to help normalize gastric emptying. Much of the halitosis dogs have stems from food retained in the stomach instead of passing on down the digestive tract in a timely manner. \nBecause your dog had cruciate tears (calling for the TPLO) we know they are prone to Shao Yang disharmony, which Adoptrex treats. In other words, the cruciate issues make it more likely that they will respond to the Adoptrex-probiotic-real food approach. \nLastly, consider adding ground fresh herbs to counter the halitosis. Parsley is an example. The fragrance of the herbs may improve things as well as combat unhealthy bacteria.\nHopefully this helps you out!"

The Cessorex can pretty much be used indefinitely, as it has a balanced effect on liver and kidney health. I don't see an issue with long term use of the Quercetin and Bromelain either.\nOnce you get your dog where you want them again, it's good practice - one at a time - to seek the lowest required dose of the supplements to keep them that way. For true allergies, expect them to recur every six to twelve months until you're in your second year of Cessorex. At that point, for many dogs, the allergies stop occurring. Fingers crossed that is true for you, too!"

For animals that are stuck on prednisone, it can mitigate some of the metabolic side effects as well as lower the required dose of the drug. Even in pituitary tumors, that is the case. Years ago, we used Four Marvels to put a cat belonging to another veterinarian into long term remission from its pituitary tumor. Since the pituitary tumor is near the optic chiasma, shrinking the tumor may take pressure off those optic nerves and allow site to be restored. Given your situation, it's the first thing I'd try. If well tolerated at label doses, use at least double or triple that amount to try to get on top of the situation. If your vet doesn't stock Chinese herbs, you can source the formula from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nIf your vet is willing to support you in the use of Chinese herbs, have them get the more powerful version known as Si Miao San (Four Marvels) from www.atimetohealherbs.com\n\nIf you try that and don't get anywhere, then give Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) a try, as you suggested. It's likely the next best thing, if Four Marvels doesn't help.\n\nGood luck and let us know how it goes.

        "answer": "Allison Shalla, that's quite a saga. You sure have been through a lot with your pup, and having her wake up blind after a dental must have been heart-breaking for all concerned. \nI'm glad you have access to a holistic vet. You're one of the few lucky ones! The very high liver enzymes and pancreatitis test result do signal a 'pathological excess'. I wouldn't choose Long Dan Xie Gan Tang (Gentiana Combination), though, because (1) your dog is on a fresh food diet (that I assume is low carb) and is therefore not really prone to Damp Heat; and (2) the extremities are cool. LDXGT plunders the Yang and is best suited to 'Purely Excessive' dogs. Your dog is more exhibiting the excess of the blood test results but then lots of \"Deficiency\", given the body wasting, cool limbs, digestive weakness and weak pulses.\nThe other two Chinese medical diagnoses that cause what you're seeing are Shao Yang disharmony and Blood stasis. They can often go together, but Shao Yang disharmony is usually the primary problem, and fits everything that is happening. \nThe Shao Yang is responsible for allowing Yang to move to the periphery, which moves Blood before it. If the Shao Yang is off the clock, Yang stays in the interior to create splenomegaly, hepatic congestion, a ravenous appetite, and tendencies to pancreatitis. \nThe formula, then, that I would ask your vet about is Minor Bupleurum (Xiao Chai Hu Tang). It also treats immune mediated disease, which is believed to be the underlying cause of SARDS, making it even more appropriate.\nIf the Stomach is too dry from all that trapped Heat and Yang, then you will need a Blood or Yin tonic to go with it. I would run the formula Yi Guan Jian (Glehnia and Rehmannia) by your vet. It works well with the XCHT, but I would use the XCHT first and see if you even need the YGJ right away. The more you can decongest the interior before adding a Yin tonic, the better. If there are no gastric symptoms from the XCHT, then you don't need to add the YGJ right off the bat, but the YGJ contains Rehmannia that may help with the confusion you're seeing (as it is half of Halscion, which is a great formula for canine cognitive dysfunction).\nThat's where I'd start, and then you could add or take away from there, depending on what it is getting better and what problems are lingering.\nLet us know how things go with your dog. After having several unlucky turns, she\ndeserves a break!"

        "answer": "Jacque Rambo, the problem will be if it does resorb. Hematomas are replaced by scar tissue when they resorb, and scar tissue contracts, resulting in a twisted deformed ear. That's why those surgeries you tried are done - to drain the fluid and prevent it turning into scar tissue. Because the fluid is notorious for coming back, a simple syringe doesn't do the trick.\nThe persistence of the fluid formation is suspected in at least some cases to be due to an underlying immune-mediated disease, perhaps damaging the cartilage in the ear. Immune diseases seem to stem from a leaky gut, which can get that way if the raw diet being fed does not contain enough plant material. To help the probiotics in Gussy's Gut thrive, anywhere from 1/6 to 1/3 of the diet needs to be plant-based. Those probiotics will then start to thrive and heal the tendency to immune mediated disease, in part by healing any leaky gut.\nIn addition to adding plants to the diet, I would use both Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) and Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials. If you don't have a source for the latter, you can contact group member Aleksandra Topic for help, using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nThese two will help normalize blood flow in the ear and counteract the tendency to immune mediated disease. They are fine to use with Yunnan Bai Yao and Arnica.\nHematomas are notoriously slow to resorb, but if you feel the ear getting cooler upon using the herbs, then another surgery this time will likely be successful, since the fluid is not likely to come back now. The surgery should help prevent the ear deformity from happening. Alternatively, you could try drainage and cold compresses, but you risk a severe infection that way.\nHopefully this helps you out, Jacque. I know it's a super frustrating problem"

        "answer": "Whimsical Cyn, there are MANY posts over a month old. The issue is that we have 100 people waiting and get about 10 new posts a day. It takes 3 hours for us to get through 10 posts - and then we have our day jobs. So we have a hard time making headway. That's why you had not yet received a reply.\n\nBVS refers to morning nausea and vomiting of bile, which has been covered a lot in the group. It doesn't necessarily sound like your dog is vomiting only in the morning, though, and blood diarrhea is not part of BVS. Perhaps the vet was hoping that giving you some sort of diagnosis would make you feel better, but BVS is actually just a symptom description - bilious vomiting - and not a diagnosis at all, so it's not super helpful in hindsight.\n\nThe Chinese medical point of view is probably more helpful. Shao Yang disharmony describes a situation where Heat (or Yang) gets trapped in different body locations, creating symptoms in the process. Sometimes it's trapped in the upper and outer body, producing seizures, vestibular disease, and the like. Sometimes it's trapped in the body interior - in the stomach and large intestine in particular - producing signs of intense thirst, vomiting, and blood diarrhea. Shao Yang disharmony is not particularly responsive to real food diets. It frequently comes on in July or August. Dogs suffering from it frequently look like they have Cushing's. The remedy is to 'open' the Shao Yang layer in the body so Yang can travel freely through it, allowing the GI to cool off. There's only one formula that does that, called Minor Bupleurum. \n\nFrom a biomedical point of view, IBD is a more likely diagnosis, or what we used to call HGE. Essentially, the intestinal lining gets inflamed, often because of a bacterial overgrowth. The damaged lining allows the immune system on the other side of it to get agitated. The agitation only serves to perpetuate the damage, this time from the inside. The goals are to calm the immune system on one side of the wall, but bolster the attack against pathogens on the other side of the wall, which again only one formula does - Minor Bupleurum. So that's where we start.\n\nNormally Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) handles IBD quite well, but it has some warming herbs which might aggravate the inflammation that is never getting a chance to go away. So Harmonize the Qi from Kan Essentials is a better choice of Minor Bupleurum.\nWe also have to assume there is a degree of ulceration given the bleeding, so adding Kan Essentials' Glehnia and Rehmannia is likely going to be needed. While you're obtaining those formulas, if you try giving something soothing like Slippery Elm and it seems to help, then you'll know Glehnia and Rehmannia will help, too.\n\nIf things improve a lot, but problems persist, you may need help getting rid of a bacterial pathogen in the gut, though I would have hoped the internist had ruled that out. If so, then Protect the Middle from Kan Essentials is called for after this initial Bupleurum/Rehmannia treatment. If there was absolutely no genetic evidence of a gut pathogen, but problems persist, then you might want to use Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials as the formula to finish off improvements.\n\nLastly, you will want to use a probiotic along with your diet and these herbs, to help combat the dysbiosis that is undoubtedly there. A simple Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus probiotic should work and will make good use of the plant material in the diet (which should be only a max of 1/3 of what you're feeding). Lactobacillus helps repair the immune system and Bifidobacterium helps repaid the wall.\n\nLet us know how things go and rest assured we were not ignoring you. We just had not gotten to you."

A visit to a chiropractor may help disclose vertebral fixations which are routinely missed on a conventional work up. Acupuncture and pulse diagnosis can help tell if you need to start with a tonifying strategy, or if there is a pathogenic excess that has beaten the dog down from a Chinese medical perspective. \nIf you can feel a strong femoral pulse on the medial aspect of the thigh, then the latter is true. Pathogenic excess might translate into a CNS pathogen of some sort or spinal cord inflammation, which Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) may well help address as a neural anti-inflammatory. If you can't even feel a pulse, Lumbrex might be a better place to start with its circulatory strengthening effects. Maybe have the vet advise on what they feel - strong or weak - so you'll know where to start, while waiting for a chiropractic and acupuncture appointment.\nHopefully this poor dog feels better soon, Charm.

My best guess as to why your dog is having fainting spells in the early morning is because (1) his evening Pimobendan dose has just about worn off that supports his heart; and (2) this is the time of day when blood pressure is usually the highest. High blood pressure means reduced peripheral blood flow, including to the brain. The medications you're using have perhaps not been enough to overcome the that vascular resistance, and when the brain doesn't get enough circulation, it turns off the lights.\nI like the things you're using to help your dog's heart, but you can do more. Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) will help resist further cardiac dilation and has a similar effect as Pimobendan on enhancing peripheral circulation, but without risk of an overdose. It's safe to use with the drug, however, so with Cessorex on board, that half dose of drug may turn out to be enough. If pulmonary hypertension is present, it will likely help with that, too.\nIf you need to use pills or tablets, you can get a Cessorex-like effect by using Kan Essentials' Harmonize the Qi with their Blood's Palace. Start with normal label doses, but then double them if the formulas are well tolerated.\nLastly, I would try Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials. Use it with the other Kan products and also with Cessorex. It will help 'raise the blood' to your dog's head, and contains added Ginseng (as do Cessorex and Harmonize the Qi) to help regulate cardiac contractility and minimize arrhythmias.\nSo, lots there you can do! I'm confident you can stop the fainting spells from happening!"

They form an excellent duo for helping combat deeply penetrated pathogens like Leishmania and preventing them from causing symptoms. Here's a thought, though. Use Kan Essentials' Open the Canals of the Liver instead. It contains Turmeric, which helps kill the parasite. All of the above formulas contain Ginseng, which has been shown to help ramp up an effective immune response against Leishmania specifically.\n\nIf and when the kidneys are significantly damaged, it may be appropriate to treat them with Rehmannia Eight, but only if the urine protein:creatinine ratio is below 3. Otherwise, what you're using for now is often the best approach to forestall renal damage.\n\nCessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs should be contemplated if anemia starts to develop in earnest and will have a balanced effect in terms of kidney support.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you're there yet, though, so meanwhile, what you're contemplating (or subbing out Harmonize the Qi for Open the Canals of the Liver) is a good way to go!

It provides extra adaptogens that calm down the adrenal glands so they don't release so many stress hormones. It also provides an excellent pick me up for older dogs and is a favourite of Dr. Karen Marsden for that purpose. From a Chinese medical point of view, the 'upward acting' effect of Lift the Qi balances the 'calming down' effect of Halscion beautifully, to comprehensively improve well being in dogs. Keep that in mind if Halscion isn't cutting the mustard.\nI'm also glad you're using some nutrients to specifically help the brain. As much as 13% of the white matter in the brain is composed of omega three fatty acids, so having an ample amount of those in the diet is important in seniors who can handle them.\nLet us know how things go, Angela.

Just introduce them one at a time. I'd do so in the order I listed them here, so you end up expelling deeply entrenched pathogens, and then 'close the door on them afterwards' with Lift the Qi.\n\nHopefully this suggestion helps you rebuild you dog's healthy gut bugs!"

        "answer": "LV Lynn, that's very strange. The first thing that comes to mind for me given the description of what happened that night is that your dog has an atlas fixation. If the veterinarian examining Rosie wasn't a chiropractor, they will likely have missed that. Or, if they were thinking 'stroke' and 'deafness', they might not have thought 'neck'.\n\nAtlas fixations are a common cause of middle-of-the-night distress in dogs. Perhaps even the most common. When a dog's atlas (i.e., their first cervical vertebrae) is jammed and immobile, about all a dog can do is try to shake their head, if it's not excruciating to do even that. They may press their ear against something to try to adjust their own neck. \n\nThe pain comes for spasms that occur in the muscles at the occiput. The nerves that relate to the ears and hearing come in and out of here. Muscle spasms here might  thus create equalization issues that hamper hearing. Or, an inner ear issue may have caused a referred pain and spasticity in the neck.\n\nGiven the above, the first thing that is needed is a careful palpation of the atlas, to see if it and the rest of the neck need adjusting. If they find issues there, ask if they have Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang on their shelf, since it helps relieve this issue. Failing that, use Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs. Muscle relaxant herbs are also helpful, including Bu Gan Tang or the Kan Essentials equivalent, known as Liver Support Formula. Even the western herb Valerian root may help relax any muscle spasms in the neck to minimize the number of chiropractic treatments needed to get your dog comfortable and hearing again. The acupuncture point that your dog will likely greatly appreciate you massaging is GB 20. Have your vet point that out to you and work away at it gently for a few minutes several times a day on each side of the head.\n\nI'm pretty sure this will help your dog out.

It's safe to use with Plavix.\nIf the stroke occurred because of urinary protein leakage, Halscion may help reduce that as well, as it provides decent balanced kidney support with its content of both Rehmannia and Bupleurum.\nIf, instead, your dog has underlying heart disease that allowed a clot to form in the heart that then embolized to the brain, then once your dog is back on his feet I would use Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) from Gold Standard Herbs plus Blood's Palace from Kan Essentials to provide cardiac support going forward.

Same entertainment value but fewer medical consequences. Besides potentially causing the microbiome to shift unfavorably (thus reactivating a leaky gut and allergies), pretty much all kibble contains AGEs. These are highly inflammatory byproducts of food processing present in all kibble, even those that are baked. About the only kibble that doesn't contain them is freeze-dried, because it is heat treatment that creates the AGEs.\nAs for treating the folds of the eyes, standard eye drops from your vet will work fine and will be a safe alternative when treating an area so close to delicate ocular tissues. \nNote that if the area looks excoriated and your dog is itchy, a remedy you can try as well is homeopathic Arsenicum album. I'd try 30C strength, and give a dose twice a day. If there's no change after 5 days, it won't help. If you do see the inflammation subsiding, find the lowest required frequency of dosing to continue those improvements. That may even be less than once a day.\nLater, when trying to find the lowest required dose of herbs, change nothing else. Work with one formula at a time, and when you reduce a dose, wait for a few days to make sure there are no repercussions. Start with the Kan products and keep Cessorex in play during that process, as the Kan products just augment what Cessorex is doing, but can never really replace it.\nHopefully this advice helps you get him back on track."

Along with taurine, it can help the heart regain the ability to generate enough energy to beat more effectively\n- Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs to help promote good renal function (which will allow the kidneys to then feedback positively on the heart). It also helps counter increased vascular resistance that creates back pressure on the heart and it helps counter or even reverse cardiac dilation and mitral valve insufficiency\nThese are just a few of the things you will hear about. Hopefully they help you out!"

        "answer": "Kristina Hall, good for you for feeding your cat real food! Processed food can be a huge cause of feline airway issues. in Chinese medical terms, it promotes Dampness, which translates into 'mucousy airways'. It doesn't sound like that is what we are dealing with here, but if the cough does ever sound very moist, consider using Three Seeds Combination from Kan Essentials. It helps undermine the tendency to inflammation that processed diets normally are the cause of, thus cutting down on phlegm buildup in the airways. \nIt's also a consideration here (despite the healthy diet) because of the sneezing. If there is a lot of nasal discharge, then you'd team it with something called Cang Er San, or Xanthium Seed Formulas. Kan makes a version that helps get rid of persistent nasal infections while cutting down on the inflammation. It's called Fragrant Jade. I'd use it with the Three Seeds to get a comprehensive airway benefit.\nNow if the sneezing and cough are not productive, one of the most consistent formulas I've found for getting rid of feline asthma is Rehmannia Eight from Kan Essentials. It doesn't really target the nose (you could use Fragrant Jade for that) but it does target the lungs well. \nRehmannia Eight is a Kidney tonic. In Chinese medical terms, you have to strengthen the Kidneys so they can 'reach up and grasp' descending Lung Qi. When the Kidneys are too weak to do that, coughing results.\nAll of these Kan products can be sourced from Aleksandra Topic if you can't find them anywhere else. She provides instructions here for doing so: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nKristina, let us know how things go.

Have the anal glands checked as they can sometimes be excruciatingly irritating, with dogs nevertheless giving no sign that they are an issue. \nAlso try to find a local chiropractor to check your dog's neck and low back. Neck fixations can create pain that is triggered by sudden movement in the middle of the night, and they often don't relent until normal neck motion is restored.\nA useful herb that can relax the neck and promote restful sleep is Valerian root, which is easy to find online. Give a robust human dose two or three times a day to see if you can get the neck to 'self adjust' (in case it's fixated) while relieving restlessness and agitation.\nIf the chiropractor identifies neck fixations, my favourite treatment to help reduce recurrence is Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs. \nSometimes for significant neck spasm and tightness, I team Lumbrex not just with Valerian, but also Liver Support Formula from Kan Essentials, which has significant muscle relaxant properties. If your vet can't or won't supply it, you can source it from friend-of-the-group Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nLastly, although it's my suspicion your dog has a neck fixation, for pure anxiety a good first choice is Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436), also from Gold Standard Herbs. \nSara, let us know how things go.

Nice work, and thank you for giving the group feedback on that, so others can duplicate your success.\nRegarding Sadie's kidneys, you're already using Rehmannia in the Halscion and the Blood's Palace, so you haven't been ignoring that. Also, her kidneys may not be in as much trouble as you think.\nElevations in SDMA are less reliable as diagnostic markers if other kidney indicators are normal (or in your case, improving). In other words, you should not assume the kidneys are worse. Also make sure that whenever they do blood work to check Sadie's kidneys, they also check her urine specific gravity (USG). Anything above 1.030 likewise tells you the kidneys are in good shape, even if the SDMA is elevated a bit.\nIf you're still worried about how to better support Sadie's kidneys, the best approach might be to beef up further the support for her heart. In other words, since things are already headed in the right direction (given the drop in BUN), I would first just double or triple the Blood's Palace dose, especially if you're just using the label dose. As for Harmonize the Qi, given you're also giving it in Halscion, you can drop down to the label dose of that formula. Those two changes should boost renal blood flow.\nLet us know how it goes, as there are probably lots of people with dogs like yours"

        "answer": "Sara HB, I'm not sure if this is still a problem for you, but I have a few suggestions:\n- Homeopathic Sulphur is famous for an ability to help with this issue. I would try 30C and give it twice daily for a few days. If there are no improvements after five days, it's not likely to help and you can  stop. If it helps a lot, then find the lowest required frequency of dosing that maintains the improvements. It may even end up being just a couple of times a week.\n- Raw diets promote allergies unless some form of fermentable carbs and soluble fiber are included. There's no real way to get around that, in my experience. These foodstuffs are needed by gut bacteria to maintain a sealed gut wall. Without them, those bacteria disappear (and probiotics to replace them simply die as soon as they are ingested, since there is no food to sustain them). It seems to me you need to make about 1/6 to 1/3 of the diet some form of plant material that does not aggravate your dog. Also make sure the probiotics contain Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus \n- You don't mention what Chinese herbs you've used, but if you have not used Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434), then it's my go-to for raw fed dogs with allergies. It's the first thing to try, and things can be added depending on what the results are, to get a more complete resolution. If there is a degree of anxiety (or OCD) driving the licking behaviour, the formula is likely to help\n- Naturally, as well, the anal glands should be examined and empties, but I assume after 5 different vets have seen her, anal gland infection or impaction has been thoroughly ruled out\nHopefully this helps!"

Harmonize the Qi is redundant as it essentially is already in Voltrex. Lift the Qi can help increase the efficacy of Blood's Palace and Voltrex, so that would be the one to add. In the event there is a cardiac cause to the cough (which commonly is signaled by coughing on rising) then that protocol should work well.\nHaving said that, if you have already tried those out, and haven't gotten anywhere, I have another idea. The coughing on rising definitely signals some fluid or mucous in the airways. If it's not cardiac in cause, one thing that can help in an elderly dog is Rehmannia Eight. In Chinese medicine, the Kidneys are believed to have to 'reach up and grasp descending Lung Qi'. If they do not, it is coughed out instead. Rehmannia Eight addresses this pretty well, and from a biomedical perspective is a good treatment for 'old dog lung' signaled by nonspecific 'interstitial' changes in chest X-rays. Maybe give that some thought if plan A doesn't help"

It is excellent for improving sphincter tone and promoting continence. It can also help relieve pulmonary congestion and calm dogs down. When they are calmer, they are less prone to collapsing trachea episodes.\nAs for the other products, continue what you know is a big help to her (e.g., perhaps the Cessorex), but Halscion should help with her allergies, too.\nHarmonize the Qi may not be needed if you're using Cessorex or Halscion. Lumbrex may not be needed unless she has neck fixations from her vestibular episodes. Maybe hold off on that until you've used the Halscion.

If dogs are so anxious that they are prone to bowel complaints, then a good combination to help them is Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials, and then Halscion afterwards if their anxiety is still somewhat over the top. Lift the Qi is excellent for addressing irritable bowel, which is commonly seen in extremely anxious and sensitive pups. \n\nMeanwhile, as you said, avoid herbs which strongly promote enhanced circulation to the bowel wall. This includes Adoptrex, Lumbrex, Cessorex and Voltrex. The beauty of these formulas is that they promote excellent peripheral circulation, but the periphery of the body includes the bowel wall. If it is subclinically inflamed because of IBS, then these formulas can be irritating unless they are used only in very low doses until the dog gets used to them.\n\nReal food diets are also important in removing tendencies to bowel wall inflammation. Ensure ample fiber since it dilates the bowel wall to relieve spasm. You may have to start with small amounts of fiber at first and work you way up in these dogs. Other formulas that can ease bowel wall spasticity and diarrhea in anxious animals is Happy Wanderer by Kan. Keep that in mind if Lift the Qi doesn't cut the mustard.\n\nHopefully that helps.

If, in stead, there was lots of squatting, consider Four Marvels.\nAs for vulvoplasty, I did a few over 30 years ago, but they are wildly uncomfortable for dogs, and I'm not convinced I helped at all. If you decide to proceed with surgery, make sure your veterinarian promises there will be no discomfort afterwards and that it is guaranteed to work. If I could go back in time, I would happily use the herbs first\nAlso confirm the nature of the stones. If they are struvite, they will dissolve once the infection is controlled, if you feed an acidifying food. Rather than reach for prescription diets to do that, just feed a fresh food diet rich in meat. The methionine in all that protein will acidify the urine nicely. If not, you can buy methionine and supplement your dog with it. Keep the carb and fat content in the diet low.\nPlease don't skip changing the diet. Studies on the metabolic impact of feeding processed food show the first organ to suffer damage is the kidneys. When the kidneys are damaged, they seed the urine with protein compounds, around which crystals accrete. I find if owners feed real meat-and-vegetable diets instead of canned or kibble diets, stones stop forming and struvite crystals quickly dissolve.\nHopefully this advice helps you out!\nHopefully this helps you out!"

The only thing I have found that consistently shrinks them and seems to prevent new ones is a low fat real food meat-and-vegetable diet. Looking up the Duck recipe, it lists a minimum of 20% fat, but 10% of the food is not accounted for by the ingredients, so it could be as high as 30% (since duck is quite fatty). Finding a diet with a maximum of 20% fat might be more helpful.\nIf she is showing specific signs, laboratory changes and symptoms, I may be able to make a more specific recommendation. Four Marvels addresses fatty liver in \"Hot\" patients (or those prone to acute inflammation). Spleen Support Formula can address fatty liver in chilly patients.

The latter is more likely to happen if the diet is not supportive of the bacteria you're using. For example, a pure raw meat diet wipes out Lactobacillus, which turns out to have an important immune regulating role. If you were to feed yogurt or goat's milk, you'd be providing Lactobacillus, but as soon as that food source is gone, there is nothing left in the diet to support them, and they would likely die off. Lactobacillus needs a carbohydrate source in the diet to sustain them, which is why I always recommend some plant material in the real food meat-based diets"

        "answer": "Paige Miller Willis, the bane of the vomiting cat's existence is processed food. If a diet helped for a while but is processed, then you're dealing with a food allergy caused by eating kibble or canned foods, even hypoallergenic ones. Why would a change in kibble help for a while? New compounds enter the GI that the immune system on the other side of the gut wall hasn't seen, so it is not yet sensitized to them. Because kibble and canned foods create a tattered gut wall (by promoting easy tendencies to inflammation), the immune system on the other side of the wall eventually starts forming antibodies at the new food, and you're right back where you started.\nFor most cats, healing starts by feeding a real food diet of some type. I know that can be a challenge for finicky cats, but I bet among our 20K members here are some that have pulled it off. To test the theory that the above explanation is right, feed your cat any real meat for a couple of weeks - sardines, cooked chicken from the grocery store, canned tuna, shredded turkey or chicken from the deli - anything. After a couple of weeks of the GI tract starting to have to work for a living instead of just absorbing processed mush, the lining will start to heal.\nA formula I've used to allow the diet to shift while healing the gut and resolving severe IBD in cats is Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) from Gold Standard Herbs. Half of the formula is the first thing I ever found that stopped chronic vomiting in cats, called Wei Ling Tang. Given the severity of the inflammation, however, I think you need the anti-inflammatory effects of Minor Bupleurum, also in the formula.\nI don't know what herbs you're using currently, but if your cat is getting worse in spite of them, you probably can take a break from them. If Adoptrex doesn't help, then we've had good luck with Four Marvels (Si Miao San). Run that by your vet if you like, or the two formulas mentioned above. They may have Natural Path versions already on the shelf ready to sell you to try.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how it goes! Lots of people have vomiting cats out there that would probably be interested in hearing!"

You don't mention what you're feeding, but given he is overweight and has significant lipomas, the diet he is eating is too 'Dampening', which can mean 'too rich in carbs', 'too rich in fat', or both. A lean meat-and-vegetable diet will help him lose weight, allowing his breathing to be easier. When dogs don't have to puff as hard, collapsing trachea improves significantly.\nAs for the conventional protocol, if it helped, then he may have had a mild infection creating enough irritation to aggravate the cough. If the improvement is not complete, then your dog is mildly immune suppressed. \nA way of remedying both the immune suppression and enhancing the efficacy of the herbs that have worked incompletely for you is to add Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials, the same company you got the other formulas from. Using all three together and moving to a lean lo-carb real food diet (if you haven't already) should remedy the problem over the next couple of weeks.\nLet us know how it goes. If Lift the Qi helps, it will be of interest to lots of other owners whose dogs have persistent collapsing trachea issues."

You just can't really tell from that photo!\nI'm also glad your dog's Cushing's has responded to my protocol of a real food diet and Four Marvels. Make sure you're giving an ample amount of Four Marvels (two or three times the label dose) or have your vet order instead the more powerful Si Miao San from www.atimetohealherbs.com \nHalscion is typically only used in dogs that don't respond to Four Marvels, so if you're sure the latter is making a difference, you can try stopping it. Instead, to further combat sludge and elevated liver enzymes, use Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) instead. It works well with Four Marvels to decongest the liver. Meanwhile, if some of the muscle atrophy is from disuse due to discomfort, Voltrex might address that well enough to get her moving, so she can build up her muscles. Like Four Marvels and Halscion, Voltrex also has a moderating and normalizing effect on adrenal output.\nLastly, consider holding off on the SAM-e. To my surprise, when I've done 'before and after' liver enzyme checks on the supplement, some dogs actually worsen. Keep that in mind as well if the introduction of Voltrex and the Four Marvels dose adjustments doesn't do the trick"

Medicus is freeze-dried, so by being less processed and not heat treated, it's considerably less pro-inflammatory than regular dog food. A further step along the anti-inflammatory spectrum would take you to home cooked diets, if you're looking to save some money. Their cooked nature will still support a weakened GI whereas by being harder to digest, raw diets can send some dogs with poor digestive power backwards.\nI'd follow your dog's lead here, and keep building digestive power while feeding anti-inflammatory meat-and-vegetable diets (freeze dried or cooked for now). Go easy on the fat and carbs for a bit. I use Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) to build digestive power while combating any tendency to gut and pancreatic inflammation. Adoptrex often keeps dogs stable enough that you can move completely over to an ideal diet, so you can begin to look at a future of fewer vet visits.\nHopefully this helps you and your pup out!"

Most typical cases of sterile meningitis are Shao Yang disharmonies, where Yang gets trapped in the head and body exterior, creating in western terms the severe CNS inflammation. In your dog's case, she is chilly. Knowing what else you're seeing can help us figure out what to use instead.\nOn the assumption that you're seeing neck pain, then the timing of aggravations (when the seasons change), together with the very low steroid doses you're able to get down to (<= 0.15 mg/kg) suggest your dog is having a Wind Cold invasion due to Blood deficiency. That condition is not responsive to Bupleurum and Kudzu, and won't ever be cured by prednisone (as it is likewise cooling). \nLumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) is used to treat this condition. It also treats a look alike condition, which your dog may actually have, namely pain from vertebral fixations and nerve impingement. That is something a chiropractor can quickly diagnose and handily treat. I'd encourage you to seek someone out with those skills.\nHopefully this helps you out. Raw is fine to continue since it visibly helps her, but I'm not clear in what way she is better on it than a cooked meat-and-vegetable diet. What symptoms went away?\nHopefully this advice helps you out! If it does, circle back as SRMA is a common 'headache' for people and their dogs!"

The change in body position as she steps over the threshold reduces her ability to hold it any longer, and out the urine comes.\nIf there is no infection and she is not needing to go out an excessive number of times, then the bladder is likely not inflamed, and the issue is with sphincter control. If we increase phytoestrogens in her body, that may be enough to tighten the sphincter so it doesn't take so much conscious control to hold it.\nThere are several things you can do to test the theory of low phytoestrogens being behind your dog's incontinence. I would probably just try all of them, but you can add them one at a time to see if any one of them does the trick, and to make sure there are no issues.\nSearch online to find soy isoflavones, and add those to your dog's food. You can also add Alfalfa (tincture is stronger). Herbal formulas to add include Restore Restraint and also Lift the Qi. These are both from Kan Essentials, which you can source from Aleksandra Topic if you need to, using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr \nIf, instead, you have a holistic vet, get a hold of the Natural Path equivalents from A Time to Heal (www.atimetohealherbs.com). They are HRUI Combination, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus). \nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Dawna Marie, true meningitis in dogs is always  caused, in Chinese medical terms, by a Shao Yang disharmony. In that instance, dogs can have issues internalizing their Yang energy. When there is ample Yang energy in the interior of the body, the Kidneys and Bladder have lots of power, and can maintain continence. When Yang is trapped in the exterior, it can promote inflammation within the nervous system (among other things), causing meningitis. Since your dog is worse when they are very animated (and thus when there Yang is mobilized to the upper and outer body), we can tell this issue is probably an extension of the Shao Yang disharmony that gave your dog meningitis.\nThe Chinese herbal formula that treats meningitis is Minor Bupleurum, and it comes in many different forms. If your dog still actively had meningitis, then I would suggest using Kan Essentials' Bupleurum and Kudzu Clearing Formula. It works virtually without fail to cure dogs of the tendency to meningitis.\nIf the meningitis is not currently a problem, then use the core of that formula, which is Minor Bupleurum. It is sold by Kan Essentials as Harmonize the Qi. If you have a holistic vet, they can source the much more powerful version known as Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum) made by Natural Path and sold to vets via www.atimetohealherbs.com\nTo help ensure success in treating the incontinence, add in Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus) from Natural Path, or the Kan Essentials equivalent known as Lift the Qi. The two formulas together - Lift the Qi, and Harmonize the Qi - treat most physiological causes of urinary incontinence, at the same time as they will treat the underlying process that puts your dog at risk of meningitis. So it's a win-win! The two formulas will also help reduce the level of agitation and excitability your dog experiences, in the event it is proving somewhat excessive.\nLet us know if you try this approach how things go with Toofie. I'm optimistic this could be an easy cure for you"

They dovetail well with each other. The doubling up of some ingredients never poses a concern if the formulas seem to be working well.\nThe other thing to recommend to them is that they change the diet to a real food diet if they have not yet done so. It is likely to help both skin and mobility issues. If they already have, and skin issues are arising anyway, then it means Cessorex is that much more likely to help. Have your client make sure the real food diet is 1/6 to 1/3 plant-based and ensure that a Bifidobacterium-Lactobacillus probiotic is given as well, for maximum benefits.\nIf they don't see the improvements they are hoping for, then another option is to use Lift the Qi from Kan Essentials instead. It likewise can benefit mobility issues as well as take care of mild skin complaints (especially those happening mid-winter).\nHope this helps!"

        "answer": "Teresa Flores Homeboy, when dogs get thick discharges and are eating processed food, Chinese medical practitioners often immediately suspect 'Dampness' as the cause. In biomedical terms, Dampness is akin to an excessive tendency to inflammation at any and all epithelial surfaces. Where it shows up in each dog varies. \nThis type of inflammation is caused by an overactive 'Innate' immune system. The innate immune system ramps up any inflammatory responses to microbial triggers when it detects a dog is eating an easily digested and absorbed source of calories, especially one rich in fat or carbohydrates. Your dog's processed food is over 50% carbohydrate (they deliberately don't list carbs on the bag, like other pet food companies, because it's not a positive feature).\nBased on that explanation, the cure is to feed an unprocessed low carb diet, which is why you hear people promoting raw diets. Easily 50% of dogs have this problem, which means a lot of dogs are cured within weeks of making that diet switch. If you don't want to feed raw, no problem. Feed a lightly cooked diet (that you can make at home if you want) or buy refrigerated cooked diets from pet stores. These days, there are more and more of them, including ones designed by veterinarians. Your local store can guide you to some choices.\nMeanwhile, to expedite the inflammation resolving benefits of a diet (but not replace them) you can use herbs that combat Damp Heat. Given that the issue is in the genito-urinary tract and has an infectious component (as suggested by the high urine pH), I would suggest Si Miao San (Four Marvels). If you don't have a vet willing to source the more powerful powdered version from www.atimetohealherbs.com, then you can get the pill or liquid version from Kan Essentials.

Cessorex is safe to use with sildenafil in treating pulmonary hypertension."

Their products truly have a global reach, I guess!\nI'm sorry to hear about your dog, but I'm glad she is slowly getting around a bit better. I don't see any signs of hip dislocation or osteoarthritis in the X-rays. For her to have gone down in hind legs, it was likely a disc prolapse. The X-ray didn't include enough of her spine for me to see whether there is disc disease. Most disc disease causing paralysis occurs at the mid-back, which is out of frame in that picture.\nIf you don't have access to a chiropractor or someone who does rehabilitative or physio-therapy, then you're doing what you can by using Lumbrex and Voltrex. For dogs with conscious limb movement, Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) is my go-to. If you recall the post about Lina Wang's dog, Bismar, it took him about 4 months to be walking normally again, so as slow as the improvements are, they seem consistent with a healing disc.\nIf you look up her post, you'll see that she fed her dog a real food diet (and continues to do so). Real food diets help the discs heal more rapidly and then prevent paralysis in the future. If you haven't yet taken that step, it's the next thing you should do to speed things along. \nMeanwhile, if you decide to add some homeopathics, they won't negatively interact with the herbs, but please don't let your homeopath talk you out of giving the Lumbrex. Although purist homeopaths often maintain nothing else should be given but the remedy, based on the rationale of Samuel Hahnemann who invented the system, the reality is that homeopathics work fine with herbs if the remedy is well indicated, based on my three-plus decades of using integrative medicine (including homeopathy).\nHopefully progress continues, Tamara. Let us know how things turn out, but you seem to be off to a good start!"

If you don't have a holsitic vet to get that for you from www.atimetohealherbs.com, then you can get the tablet or liquid version from Kan Essentials, called Sublime Joint Formula. Although named for its benefits in arthritis, the anti-inflammatory actions of the formula also help cause the involution of the corpus luteum that is maintaining the false pregnancy. It's also my favourite formula for mastitis in dogs and humans, making it doubly appropriate given the pyoderma you're seeing around the nipples. If you need help getting the Kan version, you can ask Aleksandra Topic, following the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nGood luck and let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Katharine Wight, thank you for trying to research your dog first using prior posts. You're pretty close to the mark in terms of what you should do and what is not likely to be helpful. In particular, it is very rare for Damp Heat formulas to work in a dog that is fed real-food, unless the rice component is substantial. Hopefully that is not the case here. If you are feeding a lot of rice, then Damp Heat formulas like Four Marvels can help, and you should also pull back on the Lumbrex. If your dog has been on Lumbrex quite a while and doing well, though, then it's that much more likely they are not Damp.\nCessorex is the right thing to use for skin issues that don't respond to diet change, and ultimately cures many dogs of their allergies. It can be a long wait, though, and sometimes needs a little help. If it's winter where you are, then the apparent yeast infection may be getting worse due to a natural decline in skin immunity as circulation pulls away from the skin in cold weather. In that case, Lift the Qi is the way to go, especially if the lesions are not too red or inflamed. If symptoms are severe, then Cool the Blood is the better choice to help your dog.\nHopefully this helps you out! It's a common question, as you've realized - how to back up Cessorex for dogs that don't quite heal on it. Please get back to us and let us know what happens with your pet!"

        "answer": "Danielle Mordaga, I can see the sense in everything you've tried for your dog, so I would say your holistic vet is well-trained, at least in my opinion! I have a few things for you to run by them. \nFirst, given the breed, blindness and season of onset, I would actually wonder if your dog has necrotizing encephalitis. In the first case I ever treated with this, I had to use Long Dan Xie Gan Tang (Gentiana Combination, sold by Kan Essentials as Subdue Liver Fire) to stop the inflammation. Ask your vet about that and if they have it on hand. I don't think damage is limited to the meninges here, which is why the Bupleurum and Kudzu approach didn't work. Chai Hu Jia Long Gu Mu Li Tang (or Subdue the Yang) is a good follow up formula if the LDXGT helps. The pulse in your dog should feel excessively strong for their size if this protocol is called for.\nIf instead the pulse is profoundly weak, then ask your vet about Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang, which is a formula for broad-based neurological problems (or even stroke), where hemorrhage seems to be the culprit (in case that was hinted at in the MRI report). If the weak pulse gets stronger with needling of BL 20 (assuming your vet does acupuncture) then this is the formula to try instead of what you're doing.\nEnsure there is not an atlas fixation from the vertigo that is perpetuating the inability to walk. That is a common problem. You'd need a veterinary chiropractor to evaluate your dog for that. A chiropractic adjustment works very quickly to restore mobility in many of those animals.\nLastly, vestibular disease can be caused by profound Yin deficiency, for which Yin tonics like Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin (Calm Repose), Zhi Bai Di Huang Wan (APR Nourishing) and Zuo Gui Wan (Restore the Left) are called for. Yin deficiency can also be signaled by a thin weak pulse, but sometimes it is very superficial in depth.\nOne of those strategies will hopefully work. I feel for you. It's tough when you're doing everything right but not seeing the benefits. I'm sure many of us holistically oriented dog parents can relate!"

        "answer": "Jenna Newstrom, I don't see anything wrong with their recommendations at the bottom of the lab work. It's what I would consider normal for a conventional practice - to lay out all those possible work up options. In the old days (when I first graduated!) I read an article in a now defunct veterinary journal that said (1) we owe it to the client not just to lay out all the possible workup options and then mutely sit back and hope they will opt for all of them, but that (2) we should then serve as a guide for the client - laying out a path through all the possible choices that achieves their goals in the most cost effective manner. That's actually the expertise they are paying for. In this litigious era, that second step is increasingly rare, particularly now we are in the era of corporate medicine, where returns have to be sought on practices bought for top dollar.\nThe stance of the vet that wrote that article always appealed to me, so when holistic medicine came along, I immediately recognized its value to not only myself (via professional gratification) but also the client, since it allowed me a way to link various problems together in the labwork into a story with a single definitive treatment. If the holistic treatment doesn't work, the workup is always there for you to pursue, but many times treatment is effective and the various things get better.\nYour dog's lab work to me tells a potential story: \n- low grade liver enzyme elevations frequently arise from reduced blood flow through the liver\n- reduced hepatic blood flow often leads to low thyroid levels, though that is not the only reason by far\n- cholesterol levels can also be high, because of poor liver function (since it's the liver's job to clear it from circulation)\nAll of that is just a theory and it won't be proved until you see success using a formula that increases liver blood flow. If it doesn't work, then you can do the work up as advised. So, which formula to use?\nThe high lipase suggests a little strain on the pancreas. For that reason, I would probably start with Kan Essentials Glehnia and Rehmannia Combination. If you don't have a source for that, then you can follow the instructions in Featured posts provided by Aleksandra Topic for getting it. Of course, if you had a holistic vet, I'd prefer you have them get the powdered version from Natural Path, called Yi Guan Jian. If your vet is inclined to help you, then they can order it for you from www.atimetohealherbs.com\nThe elevation in globulins is likely insignificant, since albumin is also increased. Since this was pre-operative blood work, that means your dog was probably fasted and a little dehydrated. That can produce the marginal increases in albumin and globulin you see there.\nHopefully that helps you out! Low thyroid is a ubiquitous problem in dogs. If you experience success with this approach, circle back and let everyone know!"

The problem is that the herbs in the NP product are five times more concentrated than what is used to make tablets. So you'd actually need up to five tablets to be giving the same amount as the NP product, which is why the Natural Path versions are preferable if people can source them from their vets.\nIn your case, then, start with 1 tablet twice a day. If you're not seeing the same benefits as with the NP product, try two tablets per dose for a few days; if still not better, try three and so on, until you are finally seeing the product work.\nGood luck!"

Dogs then crave something intensely cold to balance it. \nHalscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) in the Gold Standard Herbs line addresses this issue. Usually, though, there are some other symptoms to help confirm its usefulness, like Sun Downer Syndrome, insomnia, adrenal gland issues, neoplasia, and anxiety. If any of those are present, it's that much more likely to work.\nEven without those other problems, I would give it a try. But, I would also have your dog checked out (just an annual exam and routine bloodwork) to ensure there are no lurking conditions that the craving of ice is a marker for.\nLet us know how things go with your dog!

If improvements are accruing rapidly, though, it may not be necessary. It could just be a sprain/strain, and you could hurry improvements along by giving:\n- homeopathic Arnica. I use 30C strength and give it three times a day for the next two or three days, tapering down to once or twice a day as lameness improves. If the lameness plateaus and does not resolve, it's time to see the vet\n- Voltrex from Gold Standard Herbs (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) can also be used at the same time. If it's a cruciate strain, it will start the healing process, hopefully translating into steady gradual improvement. It can also be helpful as just a joint anti-inflammatory, though, which your veterinarian would be giving you a drug for, in the event of a minor sprain\nThe only other thing that can produce sudden lameness after exertion is if your dog put her back out. If there is anyone in your area that does chiropractic, they could quickly put that right. If that is what the issue is, then the above won't help very much or very quickly, except perhaps the Voltrex if it's an S-I joint. So, in addition to seeing your vet, if they draw a blank, find a chiropractor. If they do find a fixation, using Lumbrex may help prevent that from happening in the future.\nHere's hoping it's nothing, Suzanne. Let us know what happens"

You'd need a chiropractor to check for those, so find someone with a good reputation and start there. Vertebral fixations can easily explain that discomfort, especially if they are in the S-I joint. Those fixations are easy to miss, and are propagated by atlas fixations, so have whoever is doing the palpating check very carefully.\nThe other professional who can get immediate results would be an acupuncturist. I don't use a lot of laser myself, but laser applied to hip acupuncture points can theoretically also be effective. \nHopefully that gets you going.

The other 1/3 helps address the underlying cause of the 'Shao Yang disharmony', which the Bupleurum, Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell Combination treats. \nI use it as well in seizures and combine it with Kan Essentials Calm Repose. This is a prescription formula but you can source it through Aleksandra Topic, a Kan dealer, using the instructions she provides in Featured posts on this page. \nI would use both formulas and encourage you to commit fully to a real food diet. We're finding that fresh food diets can make the difference in whether animals respond to holistic treatment of tumors.\nHopefully this helps your dog out!"

If your dog is on thyroid, make sure the dose of that is not too high.\nStrong appetite in Chinese medicine is caused by Stomach Heat. Sometimes it is Damp Heat (such as in Cushing's and insulin resistance). Sometimes it is due to Shao Yang disharmony, which is the cause of collapsing trachea and many heart issues. Sometimes it is due to a pure Yin deficiency, which you have been partly addressing. In fact, if the stools are 100% normal and your dog has not been vomiting, then Yin deficiency is almost for sure the issue. If Halscion has not stopped the cognitive decline, then you can discontinue it and instead add APR Nourishing, a formula that treats Yin deficiency and associated Heat; supports the kidneys; and can improve cognition because of it's Rehmannia content. As well, add some omega 3s to the diet to support normal cognition, too. That's very important for Yin deficient dogs"

        "answer": "Sherry Page, reflux is a common issue. Given that most of the rest of the IBD issues have resolved with Halscion, the homemade diet and Lift the Qi, the culprit here might be the prednisone you're using for Addison's. It commonly has a 'Dampening' influence that can be felt in the middle of the night as reflux. \nConsider finding the lowest required dose of prednisone to test the theory. Now that your dog is on Lift the Qi and other adaptogens, perhaps they can get by with a lower dose? If the Na:K ratio in the bloodwork is over 30, there is probably room to lower the pred dose as long as you continue the other herbs that are helping. If you do reduce the pred, e.g., by half, then check the Na:K ratio again in a week or two to ensure it is still over 27.\nIf that advice doesn't sit well with you, then Adoptrex is an easy and good first choice for reflux in the middle of the night and early morning, and exerts part of its effects against Dampness that the pred might be causing. It also contains Minor Bupleurum, which we use as a natural treatment for Addison's disease, along with Lift the Qi. So maybe switching for now from Halscion to Adoptrex will do the trick for you. Adoptrex is also compatible with Halscion, if you like what it has been doing for your dog, and just want to add the Adoptrex in.\nIf that doesn't help, then for dogs that must be maintained on pred, but which are having side effects, Four Marvels from Kan Essentials is a good choice. You can likely get it the same place you obtained Lift the Qi.\nIf the 'anti-Damp' approach does help, then ensure your recipe doesn't have a lot of fat or starches in it. If it does, contact Dr. Raditic to have those amounts reduced, since they can contribute to reflux in Damp dogs.\nHope this helps!"

Fortunately, the products are available in Australia (Michelle Cummins, maybe you should make a post about this?). There's no need for 'bulk' purchases. In four to six months, you could have this licked. Also, find a local chiropractor to check and make sure there isn't a simple low back tweak causing this issue. Given the young age of the dog, that is actually my top suspicion.\nAs for mixing kibble and raw, I personally feel it's a waste of time. The kibble's impact on the system (in my clinical experience) more than outweighs the impact of any added real or raw food, probably because the kibble is getting digested first, so is always going to exert its effect on the metabolism, leading to heightened propensity to inflammation and degeneration. I know many feel some real is better than none, but I think it's misleading to offer an expectation of an improvement. I just don't see it until pretty much the whole diet is fresh food."

Of those, the one most indicated for pancreatitis (if that is still an issue) is Glehnia and Rehmannia from Kan Essentials. If that has since resolved, though, and the primary concern is a kidney infection, the main formula to consider is Rehmannia Six (as opposed to Rehmannia Eight). Rehmannia is a good choice for renal infections because it helps boost blood flow to the kidneys, with that jump in blood flow then bringing the immune system to the kidneys, allowing it to do battle with this opportunist infection. I would try that first for a week or two and then rechecking the labs, before resorting to chloramphenicol, if for no other reason than it benefits the whole dog. The other reason to try it first is that if chloramphenicol is going to cause issues, they are often with the bone marrow. Since Rehmannia helps boost bone marrow activity, you might be less likely to see that side effect.\nIf the UTI includes full on cystitis as well as a kidney infection, then instead of Rehmannia Six, try APR Nourishing Formula from Kan Essentials, which is Rehmannia Six, but with two antimicrobial herbs added for the bladder. You can likely source all these from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides in Featured posts on this page.\nHopefully this helps you out!"

        "answer": "Claire Lenthall, I assume being 'stressed' and having a hard time 'settling' means you're seeing a lot of panting and pacing. If so, and especially if it's worse in the evening hours, then Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs is our go-to. It relieves anxiety and stress through its adaptogenic effects on the adrenal glands, and helps dogs learn what is truly a problem and what is not by supporting blood flow in the pre-frontal cortex. If you're sure pain and discomfort is not an issue with Otis, that is probably the first thing you should try. It also supports liver blood flow to help raise albumin levels, which is currently the only thing showing as wrong with the liver in the blood work you provide.\nIf you haven't yet ruled out aches and pains as a cause of any panting and pacing, though, then you should. Pains better with movement are called Stasis, and can foster restlessness and stress that show as panting. A remedy you can try out for the panting restless dog who is achy is homoeopathic Rhus toxicodendron. I use 30C strength. It fits the picture of 'Liver Blood deficiency' that is implied by the low albumin levels.\nThose are just two of many possible suggestions. You might also pay a visit to a chiropractor and an acupuncturist to help make sure this is purely a cognitive issue. If chiropractic fixations are found to be the cause of the discomfort, then Lumbrex from Gold Standard will help while still supporting blood flow to the liver and prefrontal cortex"

It sounds like we have to find a way to keep that gravy train running!\nI have never heard of tongue related problems in response to Voltrex, so all of what comes next is speculative. I'm going to suggest it is the shriveling of the tongue that was making it move funny, not so much a neurological problem. In Chinese medicine, the shriveling of the tongue is indicative of Yin deficiency, which commonly attends Shao Yang disharmony. Shao Yang disharmony is what Voltrex treats. So, in Chinese parlance, you've 'pruned the branches' of Shao Yang dishamony causing hip dysplasia, and exposed the 'root' condition of Yin deficiency. \nIf that is correct, using a Yin tonic should resolve the condition, allowing you to continue Voltrex. You have a couple of options. One is to try Glehnia and Rehmannia from Kan Essentials. You can source that from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides in Featured posts, since your vet is not holistically oriented. Using a triple dose of it, and maybe half levels (for now) of Voltrex may relieve the lameness and the tongue issue.\nAnother simpler method would be to get Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard and use it in addition to the Voltrex. It contains the Glehnia and Rehmannia formula, and is our top recommendation anyway for dogs with head tilt, so it's doubly appropriate. It may help that tongue stay moist and allow you to use the Voltrex. I've also used it successfully in stroke patients - not that this is what is going on in your dog's case, but just in case 'stroke' was mentioned, know it's still appropriate"

To actually heal stomach ulcers, we use Glehnia and Rehmannia (sold under that name by Kan and as Yi Guan Jian to vets by Natural Path). \nIf your dog has a simple stomach ulcer, that might be all you need. Dogs that respond to Voltrex commonly have a predisposition to stomach ulcers. This formula can help make Voltrex tolerable in those dogs and heal their ulcers.\nIf your dog has stomach cancer, then the formula you can try in addition to G&R or instead is Six Gentlemen (sold by Kan as Six Gentle Pets, or by Natural Path to vets as Liu Jun Zi Tang). For some reason, that formula is frequently curative in stomach cancer.\nIt's nice to eventually have a more targeted approach, so the body is allowed to 'focus' on just one or two things, making responses more pronounced. But all of these are compatible with what you're doing, if you're just not sure. \nHopefully this helps your dog out!"

Lift the Qi would potentially interfere with that a little, so I don't use the two routinely together. See what you can accomplish in the MUE by using the B&K alone first. It is often rapidly curative of meningitis, allowing you to then reduce the immune suppressant drug use. \nIf those drugs are being used to treat skin issues, then Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434), a diet change and probiotics are next steps to securing the long term health of your dog.

        "answer": "Hi there! When dogs feel worse on Blood and Yin tonics like Lumbrex, it usually means they are Damp. Dampness in Chinese medical terms is the same thing as 'being inflamed from eating processed food' in biomedical terms. That is, we really only see those aggravations in dogs on canned or kibble diets, which means they are the actual problem. If you haven't made the move to real food, it is a good first step, since it is the processed food that causes the impairment of circulation to the spine that makes disc disease possible in dogs; and also a predisposition to systemic inflammation that can manifest as osteoarthritis or GI discomfort in response to certain triggers (like Lumbrex, in this case).\nAs for how to proceed, first stop the Lumbrex. The herb clears the system within less than 24 hours, so lingering symptoms after that are arising from your dog, not the product. I'm guessing there will be some lingering issues, calling for (a) the diet change, and (b) an anti-Dampness herbal formula that has some reputation for arthritis and disc disease. Probably the main one to think of there is Free the Sinews from Kan Essentials, but if there is a lot of lingering apparent abdominal discomfort, Three Seeds Combination could be used in addition or instead.\nOne of the things that could be going on that has nothing to do with the herbs is a  urinary tract infection, which can cause a lot of those symptoms you're seeing but have nothing to do with the herb. A urinalysis would be needed to rule that out. Bladder infections are a common thing in disc dogs if complete voiding is inhibited by the spinal pathology. We commonly use Three Seeds to help with that, so it would be one more reason to give it a try, if that is what is going on.\nHopefully this helps you out!"

A real food diet is called for as well, if you haven't tried that yet.\nNow the only fly in that ointment is the lack of response to NSAIDs. Usually Voltrex cases do benefit a bit. If they do not, then 'Wind invasions' and 'Blood or Kidney deficiencies' are more likely diagnoses, calling for something like Lumbrex from Gold Standard Herbs. If it helped, it would imply that chiropractic issues are potentially playing a role. Neck fixations can create obstinate forelimb lameness (and are the chief cause of that, in my experience). Low back fixations can create lingering hind limb issues.\nMany people cover all bases by starting with Voltrex, and then if they don't see the improvement they wanted after a few weeks, adding in Lumbrex. Sometimes both end up bringing something to the table.\nIf you give this a try, Dr. Wagner, let us know.

You could make it right in your kitchen, along with your own food. I've uploaded some Home Cooked diet guidelines in the files on this page, for you to institute temporarily while you figure this out. You can also buy commercially prepared meat-and-vegetable diets. \nRemember that whatever diet you feed in the next few weeks is not necessarily a forever thing. Right now, you're just testing 'proof of concept'. If you introduced Four Marvels (mentioned in the video) and the real food diet and in three weeks your dog was improved, you'd know that you're on the right track. Meanwhile, your dog's appetite would slowly drop as insulin levels and cortisol started to come under control. So at that point you could more accurately determine what is a sustainable path for you going forward. If you're in a hurry to get the appetite under control, I'd get a hold of the herb. Aleksandra Topic provides instructions in Featured posts on how to get it through her.\nLet us know how things go. Hopefully in a few weeks your dog will be overtly better."

        "answer": "Michele Vitali, if your dog's kidney issues are not responding to Rehmannia Eight, but not worsening, I have a few suggestions:\n- if you're using Kan Rehmannia Eight at the label dose, try doubling or tripling the amount you're giving. I find the dose on the label is too low\n- you can add another Kan product called Three Seeds Combination to reduce renal inflammation, and create more room in the kidneys for Rehmannia Eight to increase the blood supply\nAlso note that the UPC is just a guideline. If the above two suggestions don't work, try briefly using Voltrex or Benefit Hips and Knees (Kan) to lower the Lyme titer down. Once it is down, try the Rehmannia again. Note, though, that if the kidney enzymes go up with the use of either of these formulas, then just switch back to Rehmannia/Three Seeds, and try giving more.\nLastly, feed a real food diet if you're not already. Processed diets affect the metabolism in a way that causes inflammation to not 'actively resolve'. In the case of the kidneys, that could manifest as persistent protein loss and kidney enzyme elevation.\nHopefully one of these ideas works for you. Let us know how things go!"

Modified Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood; mXFZYT) and Hawthorne together provide the same benefits of vasodilation and increased contractility, so you may have everything you need already in place. \nI would consider adding a Minor Bupleurum derivative. Since you apparently have a holistic vet at your disposal, ask them if they  would be willing to supply it. It enhances the efficacy of most Blood movers (like the mXFZYT) and contains Ginseng, which inhibits Calcineurin in the heart. Inhibition of that enzyme has been show to reverse heart muscle changes, allowing hearts to come back to a normal shape and size. I would guess that with that formula added and the feeding of a real food meat-and-vegetable diet (which is important as well), you might see those ultrasound changes entirely reverse, even with Pimobendan not being in use"

        "answer": "Natalia Victoria, that's something we don't see everyday, although the radiologist was not convinced it could be the cause of the problems you're seeing. The occasional hopping and skipping gait described is most common in dogs with a problem in the low back and sacrum, causing for example nerve pinching that makes a dog reflexively jerk it's leg upward and/or avoid extending it. Vertebral fixations causing a pinch are too subtle to be able to be detected in most dog radiographs, even if vets were taught these are 'a thing', which most of us are not. Hence, I would seek out a local chiropractor to evaluate the hind end, since relief of a fixation there could produce immediate dramatic improvements.\nWhether the issue is facet osteoarthritis or low back fixations, there's no reason to expect this has to be an enduring problem for you. Both conditions arise from progressive spinal stiffening from an impaired blood supply. When connective tissues (like ligaments, discs and joint capsules) are deprived of a quality blood supply, they start to calcify, producing rigidity. The unyielding tissues create more tension where they insert onto bone. Bone is covered by periosteum, whose response to increased tension is to manufacture more bone in the direction of where the tension is being applied. Over time, this can lead to osteophytes (in the case of joints) and spondylosis in the ventral back. When discs become calcified and brittle, they are more likely to tear, producing disc disease and paralysis.\nThat circulatory issue is, in virtually all dogs, driven chiefly by the feeding of processed diets. Their ready absorption changes the body's metabolism, leading over time to something called endothelial dysfunction. It is this vessel malfunction that messes with blood flow to the back. Real food meat-and-vegetable diets are the antidote, and tend to prevent further declines from occurring within a few months., so hopefully you have made the move away from kibble and canned foods.\nWe can accelerate the restoration of normal spinal circulation and suppleness in most dogs using Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) from Gold Standard Herbs. It supports the restoration of normal blood vessel behaviour in the back that allows a gradual return of suppleness to the spine, stopping the development of more ostephytes, and reducing the need for chiropractic treatment. The vast majority of dogs respond to it and tolerate it well. PEMF can have a similar effect on blood vessels - not enough to counteract the ill effects of a processed diet - but once the diet is changed, chiropractic, Lumbrex, and PEMF should produce very rapid improvements in your dog."

        "answer": "Magda Moroz, I've been a veterinarian for over 35 years now, and never have referred even one dog for hip replacement. If your dog essentially has no hips left, then I guess it would be needed, but if it's a routine case of hip dysplasia, then Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438), augmented later by Lumbrex, from Gold Standard Herbs, is likely to produce dramatic improvements, especially if you can move your dog to a real food diet. Processed food diets set in motion the degenerative processes in canine joints by disrupting blood flow, which NSAID drugs unfortunately then perpetuate, even as they provide comfort. A real food diet is the antidote to that situation, along with the two Gold Standard products.\nYou should also seek out help locally from acupuncturists and chiropractors. They can produce immediate improvements. All of these interventions together usually improve the comfort and function level of dogs so much that a surgery is not really justified. In fact, we have radiographic evidence the above can actually heal the ligament rupture that allows hip dysplasia to occur, so that animals become 100% sound regardless of bony architecture. You can learn more about this approach in a talk I did for Sarah MacKeigan and her Dogs That Can podcast.

        "answer": "Toini Yasmine Solsikke, if you search this group, you'll see we've addressed how to approach vaccines a lot. I'll just summarize what I consider an ideal strategy here and leave it to you to figure out how to apply it in Norway.\nSince your dogs look mature, they may not need any more shots at all. I'm guessing the 'one shot' you mentioned covers Distemper, Parvo, and Parainfluenza. These vaccines used to be given every year, until it was decided every three years was enough. In reality, even every three years is probably way too much.\nIn North America, veterinarians can now submit a blood sample and find out if any antibodies already exist against Distemper and Parvo in their dog's blood. If so, then they are primed to fight the disease. Specifically, in a dog over 14 weeks of age, if ANY antibodies are found at all (even if they are just a 'weak positive' for either virus), then the challenge studies performed by Ron Shultz, North America's chief vaccine tester for the past several decades, indicate that dog does not need vaccination for Parvo and Distemper ever again. You can read an interview of Ron Shultz for his recommenations by clicking on the PFD located here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/permalink/1448009139096294\nRabies titers are likewise preferable to just routinely vaccinating. If you pursue that, ask for a titer that provides a quantitative measurement suitable for international export. A titer of greater than 0.5 IU/ml tells you the pet would be considered safe to travel to another country and not prove a rabies risk. That tells you, in turn, that no vaccine is currently needed. \nProvincial and State laws in Canada and the US often demand renewal of protection against rabies every three years, so you could check again then to see if your dog still passes muster without the need for a shot. I'm not sure what the law is in Norway. It's my experience a rabies titer often is protective for five to seven years, once the first two boosters have been given one year apart. In theory, for many dogs, just three or perhaps a maximum of four rabies shots would typically give lifelong immunity.\nOf course, all this is moot if your vet or local laws don't allow titer testing as a means of demonstrating protection (which would be a  completely unscientific stance, but not all laws are logical). You may be able to find a local open-minded veterinarian who embraces titer testing and can navigate the local laws for you so your dog receives the least amount of vaccination that is biologically required to protect them from these diseases.\nWhat's the risk in vaccination? It's primarily adjuvant exposure. That's why divvying up the 3-in-1 shot is not necessarily advantageous, per Dr. Shultz. The more often a dog or cat is injected with adjuvants, the more prone they become to vaccine side effects, which are primarily immune-mediated in  nature, and range from the mild to the catasrophic. If you are forced to give a rabies vaccine, I find that homeopathic Thuja 30C given two to three times daily beginning a couple of days before and a couple of days after the shot seems to prevent reactions in many susceptible animals. It often can blunt the immune response to the vaccine, meaning the titer won't be as high (thus perhaps necessitating giving more shots in the future), but at least that is proof that the remedy is doing something, regardless what detractors of homeopathy may have to say.\nHopefully this is enough for you to figure out what to do, or what can be done, in your situation."

Pancreatitis is especially common in the fall months, because at least from a Chinese medical perspective, digestive power is weakest during these months, and the risk of internal organ inflammation relatively higher.\nThere are actually several different ways to cure your dog of pancreatitis tendencies, depending on their constitution. I detail them here in this course I did for Judy Morgan, if you're interested: https://www.drjudyu.com/offers/NZL4A6oy/checkout\nThe first step is generally to change your dog's food to a real food meat-and-vegetable based diet. Processing of food, you'll see in the course, actually primes the pancreas of most dogs to become inflamed (and many cats, too).\nIf you're not interested in taking the course just yet to solve this, then one thing that often works for pancreatitis that comes on in the fall months is Adoptrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Adoptrex-85g-p647327433) by Gold Standard Herbs. It strengthens digestion, reduces that predisposition to internal inflammation, and can help prevent a diet change from sparking further GI issues. All told, then, for you it may be the first thing to try."

        "answer": "Michelle Walker, please search out posts in this group that discuss urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratios. You'll see that is the main test I recommend in trying to decipher how best to support your dog's kidneys. Your vet can run this test for you on a non-sterile urine sample. \nIf the UPC ratio is less than 3, a Rehmannia product is what to reach for. Generally, Rehmannia Eight from Kan Essentials is safe and pretty effective for most dogs in that category. Rehmannia works by increasing the quantity and quality of blood flow to the kidneys. In the five product combination you mention you were using, I don't see any plants with that action.\nIf instead the UPC ratio is above 4, then Voltrex from Gold Standard Herbs (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) is a good option. This value means your dog's kidneys are most likely subacutely inflamed. If we use Rehmannia in those animals (or a lot of fluids), we run the risk of making the situation worse, since we would then be pushing a lot of fluid into an already congested area. You need an anti-inflammatory first, for at least a few weeks, and then Rehmannia and fluids would become more helpful (attended by a drop in the UPC).\nYour last test showed no protein, but it would be wise to confirm one more time. If none, then Rehmannia is called for. Otherwise, his history of congestive heart failure and pneumonia are consistent with Voltrex.\nIf the protein is once again negative, try using Blood's Palace as your Rehmannia source, since it will also improve cardiac output and help manage the heart failure, while more powerfully boosting renal blood flow. Also experiment with using more Dandelion and less Furosemide (Lasix) to further reduce the burden on the kidneys. You'd need your vet to have a quick listen to the lungs every time you dropped the Lasix and upped the Dandelion to make sure the lungs sounded, if anything, less congested.\nHopefully this helps you out. I'm confident you can have your dog feeling a lot better. If for some reason you can't run the test, then Cessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) by Gold Standard Herbs can give you a blended effect. It can help support the heart shrinking and a boost in cardiac output, which supports the kidneys. It has Minor Bupleurum in it, to help de-inflame the kidneys, and lots of Rehmannia to improve their blood supply. In the absence of lab testing, I guess that formula would be perhaps the safest choice, but if the kidneys are inflamed, it wouldn't bring that inflammation down as fast as Voltrex."

Add gentle chiropractic to your list of treatments as well and make sure these interventions are including the thoracolumbar junction, since that is where the trauma to the cord usually is that causes DM. \nIn case you're right and there is some sort of 'deep cord injury' stemming from the procedures, then adding Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) may help. That's not to say they did anything wrong during the spinal tap. It is just that DM dogs are uniquely situated to be very vulnerable to enduring cord impairment from interventions that should normally help. Voltrex is our go-to for that sort of situation and can be used with DM Formula.\nLastly, consider a Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium probiotic, and making your dog's diet at least 15% and up to 1/3 by volume plant-based, by adding some combination of fruits, veggies, whole grains or beans. This is just in case there is a role of the microbiome in the disease.

You can source it if you need to from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nYou'll also no doubt have read how crucial it is for the diet to be at least 15% whole plant food by volume, and not just raw meat. Pure or mostly pure raw diets starve out propionate producing bacteria in the microbiome. Propionate is needed to allow the immune system to function properly. Make up to 1/3 of the diet some mix of fruits, vegetables, beans or even whole grains. Also then add a probiotic containing those propionate producers, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.\nLastly, to target the lick granuloma specifically, you can add in Sublime Joint Formula from Kan Essentials. It will help target the localized infection that is perpetuating the granuloma. Acupuncture techniques like 'Circle the Dragon' can enhance the effects of the formula, by helping increase access of the blood supply to the walled off bacteria inside the granuloma. You can even use the formula topically in an emollient ointment like Calendula, to help accelerate the breaking up of the mass, such that the blood supply can enter it.\nI'm confident if you implement the above, you'll see your dog more visibly improve within a couple of weeks"

An exam can help the practitioner a lot in selecting an ideal treatment, so please put the effort in to find someone. It's also important to feed a real food diet to increase the odds of stopping the growth of a tumor.\nWhile you're trying to find someone, you can try a couple of formulas I have found helpful for dealing with masses in the chest and neck: Dispel Stasis in the Palace of Blood, and also Harmonize the Qi, both from Kan Essentials. Normally you need a practitioner to source those for you, but you can get them from fellow group member Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here.\nHopefully that at least stabilizes the tumor, but if you're lucky it may shrink it."

In my experience, Lumbrex and Voltrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Voltrex-85g-p647327438) along with a healthy real food diet and probiotics are what are doing the heavy lifting here. At the opposite end of the spectrum, so far as the joints are concerned, are the quercetin, mushrooms, colostrum and bee pollen. As for the other joint items, I've never seen antler velvet bring a lot to the party, but that's me.\nHow to navigate the huge supplement list? It helps to remember that medicine is like playing darts. You can rack up points, which all of those help you do, but if you hit the bullseye (with Game Changing supplements like Voltrex and Lumbrex), then you don't need any more points. With that in mind, keep the likely bullseyes. \nA useful goal, including even for the Game Changing bullseye supplements, is to find the 'lowest required dose' needed to maintain your dog's improvements. Reduce the dose of just one supplement at a time, starting with ones that just rack up points, and discontinue it if you don't see any resurgence of symptoms at very low doses.\nOf course, if you're almost out of something, try stopping that one first before you re-order it. If your dog is worse within a few days, you know that supplement is helping a lot. If you don't see a change, then you can look at what else is running low.\nHopefully that helps"

If your dog has the typical extreme thirst and dilute urination on a real food diet, then Halscion from the same company might work even better. Otherwise if it's just skin that is the issue, Cessorex is the better choice. In both cases, use Cool the Blood."

Your vet should be able to conduct specific tests to rule them out.\nScurvy doesn't occur in dogs because they make their own vitamin C. Liver compromise would have to be severe for a dog to no longer be able to make vitamin C. I assume the vet has done blood work to rule out liver disease?\nWhether due to an infection or an excess immune response, ITP and IMHA often responds well to a combination of Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs and Cool the Blood from Kan Essentials. Use double or triple the dose of Cool the Blood to get a good effect. You can get Cool the Blood from Aleksandra Topic if you like, using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nThe combined effect of the formulas will be to stimulate the bone marrow (which stops working in these conditions) to make more platelets and RBCs. Meanwhile, the herbs will stop overzealous clearing of platelets and damaged red blood cells by the spleen and liver. Lastly, they will calm down the excessive exuberance of the systemic immune system which is driving the reaction.\nEven if you’ve started drug therapy, I would use these herbs, as they are much more likely to be curative than the drugs.\nLastly, raw fed dogs should have ample plant material (e.g., beans, fruits and vegetables) in their diets – maybe up to a third of what is in the dish – and should be supplemented with probiotics like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. If this is not an infection, but a runaway immune response, that sometimes happens because there is no propionate being synthesized in the microbiome to help control the immune system. Bugs like Lactobacillus make propionate, but are killed off by all meat diets, or even ones where the meat constitutes > 85% of the diet.\nHopefully this advice is coming soon enough to be useful. Let us know how things go!"

In acute cord injury, a spike in neuronal nitric oxide levels from the injury, resultant inflammation, and now the surgery causes a cessation of nerve signals to the limbs. Voltrex is the only supplement out there that subsides nNO levels and cord inflammation enough to allow nerve signals to resume.\nAfter a couple of weeks, when purposeful limb movement is resuming, it will be time to add in Lumbrex, another Gold Standard Herbs product. That formula should complete the cord healing process. A real food diet will expedite and make as complete as possible that recovery.\nOnce purposeful limb movement is seen, seek out local chiropractic assistance. Vertebral fixations caused by the accident that impinge on the cord can interfere greatly with nerve signals. As soon as the acuteness of the injury is over (signified by a return of some purposeful movemen on Voltrex), it should be safe to get chiropractic done.\nHopefully this helps you out. Let us know how things go!"

Voltrex helps lower nitric oxide in injured cords, so signal transmission happens sooner.\nHopefully the clinic will let you administer these medications if your dog is still in hospital. If not, you'll have to wait until your pup is stable enough to come home before starting these.\nLet us know what happens, but your dog should recover fully.

I have a couple of ideas you can explore.\nFirst, this can be a symptom of IBD, which may not fully resolve until a real food diet is instituted. Try to find real fresh foods (e.g,, chicken, sardines, liver) that can form the foundation for a real fresh food balanced diet for cats. There are many resources online for how to create that diet if you find she has an appetite for real meat. Three Seeds from Kan Essentials can resolve IBD in cats that really need a diet change, and it relieve difficulties passing stool that might make them more apt to use the litterbox.\nSecond, this behaviour can indicate low back pain in cats. They don't feel it until they bear down during a bowel movement. Because it's painful, they associate the place where it first happened (i.e., the litter box) with the problem, and seek out places where they feel safe and not threatened (like your lap, the bed, etc.). To rule this out, have a detailed chiropractic exam done on your cat if you can, looking for low back fixations. If they are there, treatment can produce immediate relief. In this situation, I have found the Kan Essentials formula known as Sublime Joint Formula can help resolve the back pain and restore normal bowel movement patterns.\nThird, just about anything they don't like about the litter box can likewise have them looking for a more pleasant place to defecate, so try different litters, litterbox locations, etc.\nLastly, a formula that helps your cat de-stress while promoting normal gut motility and relieving low grade inflammation may help. An example is Happy Wanderer, which I have successfully used to resolve elimination outside the litter box.\nWhere to get Kan Essentials formulas? They are often on Amazon, though Kan does not vouch for their quality. You can be guaranteed about their quality by buying from Kan distributors like Aleksandra Topic, a friend of our group. To do that, just follow her instructions here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nHopefully this helps you out.

You can source those from Aleksandra Topic if you like, by following her instructions here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nCessorex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Cessorex-85g-p647327434) from Gold Standard Herbs contains many of the herbs in those two formulas, so it is another option for trying to counter hypertension and shrink the heart back down so it beats more effectively.\nRegardless which of the above you institute, make sure you're feeding a real food diet to help stop the progression of the disease. It will also help your dog lose excess weight easily, which should likewise ease the burden on the heart.\nLastly, consider adding basic cardiac support supplements like taurine, Hawthorne, and Coenzyme Q10. You can learn more about this approach in the new videos on heart issues uploaded to the Ask Dr. Steve Youtube page: https://www.youtube.com/@askdrstevedvm\nHopefully this helps you out!"

That will likely eventually happen here, but it's not a big deal so far as her health is concerned. She just may not make as much money during her photoshoots! Meanwhile, don't fiddle with them as it will just accelerate the inevitable. If you wiggle them to try to straighten them, they will likely come out that much sooner. And getting food out from between the teeth is the right thing to do. If you left it there, the teeth would likewise come out that much more quickly."

        "answer": "Hi there! I've yet to hear of or see a case fail to be cured of sterile meningitis (aka MUE) by Bupleurum and Kudzu Clearing Formula. Given the onset in January and now July, it's virtually guaranteed to work here, eliminating the need for immune suppressants and those secondary infections. It also helps normalize liver and biliary tract function, so should help eradicate the bactobilia. It's the first thing I'd try.\nIf there are lingering symptoms specific to the meningitis, introduce the herb and see if they improve over the next couple of weeks. If so, the way is clear for reducing the immune suppressants.\nIf all meningitis symptoms are now gone, then I would say you could start the herb AND start slowly reducing the dose of immune suppressants at the same time. \nIt would be great if there was a holistic vet in your community to shepherd you through this. If you implement the above, then keep an eye on the lab work to make sure the liver disease indicators are moving in the right direction. If you get rid of the MUE and are off the drugs, but there are persistent liver issues, circle back with the details and we can help you figure out the next step."

If Voltrex helped the cruciate, Cessorex is almost for sure going to help the skin, and is the first thing I try in raw fed itchy dogs. \nIt's also important to make sure that up to 1/3 of what is in the dish is some form of plant material, such as vegetables or fruit. Lastly, be sure to add a probiotic containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. It's the lack of these bacteria and the plant material in the diet that they feed on that is the cause of allergies in raw fed dogs.\nOne final note, though. If the itching and redness is STRICTLY on the belly and only during 5 to 7 am, then another thing that may cure it for you is Glehnia and Rehmannia from Kan Essentials. It pairs well with Voltrex and can specifically help that symptom picture. If you want to give it a try first, then you can obtain it from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nIf in doubt, all three formulas can be used together, but it's worth adding one at a time to see which one is doing the heavy lifting.

Adaptogens 'generate' the ability to 'adapt'. A failure to adapt leads to stress. Logically, then, Adaptogens relieve stress, and accomplish this by working through the adrenal glands.\nHow do the adrenal glands factor into stress? The sensation of 'anxiety' is generated in the hippocampus, deep in the core of the brain. An excess amount of adrenaline or cortisol released from the adrenal glands heightens the sense of anxiety. By making sure that the adrenal glands are normalized in their output, you can remove a lot of that emotional intensity. None of the formulas you've tried work in that fashion, so this a new stone to turn over for you, and works for most dogs.\nIf you have the time, start with Halscion, since it's readily available, and then if it's not cutting the mustard, either switch to or add in Lift the Qi. This way, you can know what each formula is doing individually for your dog. If things are super bad, though, you can just start both formulas together. They work well together to great a very balanced effect as the normalize brain and adrenal function.\nIf you give it a try, let us know how things go!"

        "answer": "Rachel Arthur, if you stop Lumbrex and the appetite is not improved within 24 hours, then there is another cause. If your dog is still suffering imbalance, that is probably the cause of the loss of appetite. The dizziness makes dogs (understandably) feel nauseous. \nI'm not sure how your vet managed to rule out vestibular disease, unless it was because of a lack of eye movements back and forth. If those were indeed absent, then the problem is due most likely to an atlas fixation, which can be painful enough to also cause a loss of appetite. A chiropractor can evaluate and treat your dog, producing immediate relief and likely a jump in appetite. The lengthy pre-treatment with Lumbrex would likely help ensure a good response to chiropractic.\nIf the eyes are moving back and forth, then Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs is what I would use to treat your dog. Vestibular disease is super common from July on through the fall, so if that's when it started, then it is that much more likely that your dog has vestibular.\nIf there are no eye movement issues, and if chiropractic has been done and your dog is much better, but you're using Lumbrex to keep problems away, then if the appetite is weak, you could use instead Free the Sinews from Kan Essentials. You can source the product from Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nAlternatively, if Lumbrex clearly helped, then rather than stopping it and ripping the rug out from beneath your dog, try stopping the herb until the appetite bounces back, then re-starting at half doses or lower.\nHopefully that allows you to sort out the cause!"

Assuming you are, in fact, seeing a decline in lameness, the cracking on rising is likely not an issue to worry about. It's probably the same thing that happens as people go up or down the stairs painlessly, yet hear cracking in their own knees. The explanation for painless  joint cracking is that sudden pressure placed on the joint (such as by rising, or from going upstairs) is the sound of dissolved gases coming out of solution to form bubbles in the joint. As the pressure is then released, the bubble 'pops' creating the noise."

Add those supplements to your regimen, and you may see that titer finally drop.

        "answer": "Tara Morgan, Eyebright is not likely to help as much with the EKC (eosinophilic keratoconjunctivitis) as it is an immune mediated condition. Eyebright doesn't really have that kind of power, and is more just anti-inflammatory.\nThe hyperthyroidism, small cell lymphoma and EKC all have one thing in common, which is a leaky gut. The lymphocytes on the inside of the gut wall get chronically agitated by their ability to see just a bit too much of the bacteria on the other side of the wall. Taken to extremes, they can start to transform into small cell lymphoma cells. Otherwise, they elaborate antibodies and cytokines which can cause other immune mediated symptoms like EKC. Hyperthyroidism in my book is an autoimmune problem in cats, just like it is for people.\nSo the big thing you're looking for is how to moderate the immune system, preferably with something anti-cancer, while sealing the gut at the same time. You can achieve that with:\n- Harmonize the Qi (i.e., Minor Bupleurum) from Kan Essentials \n- a real food raw or cooked meat-based diet. \nA whole prey diet might be especially helpful here, if you can source one that your cat will eat. Many cats can be enticed to eat something if you sprinkle nutritional yeast on top.\nI think if you can implement just those two steps, you'll see a comprehensive improvement in your cat. Let us know how it goes if you give it a try"

        "answer": "Aimee Legendre, ruling out Zinc Responsive Dermatosis is easy and safe. I can't see a reason not to try it. I see lots of zinc supplements for dogs online to try out.\nAs for the elevated lipase, ensure your raw food is not too high in fat. Generally it should be about 30% or less on a dry matter basis. To figure that out from the guaranteed analysis:\n- from 100, subtract the value for water\n- divide the number for fat by the number you obtained in the step above. If it's more than 0.30 (or 30%), then seek a lower fat diet, to be safe.\nAs well, if there is a lot of liver in the diet, try one without liver for a bit, or at least for most of the week. The copper in liver can interfere with the absorption of zinc from meat.\nHopefully that helps!"

        "answer": "Hi there! I think your idea of seeking out a chiropractor is a good one. It sounds like there is a nerve pinch there that is not felt when at rest, but is aggravated a little when moving around. If so, a single chiropractic treatment might resolve it.\nTechnically Lumbrex (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Lumbrex-85g-p647327437) should make the spine more limber over time, so the nerve pinching is less. You could perhaps try bumping up the dose of that product, especially with the history of luxating patellas.\nHopefully that helps!"

        "answer": "Deb Brasted, that's an interesting case you have there. I haven't used Ypozane, so I have no feedback to share. Maybe others have. You're correct, though, that BPH is technically due to the effect of testosterone on the prostate, and that neutering will remove that effect. I see your reluctance to do that, though, given the anxiety your dog experienced when you temporarily 'chemically neutered' him with the Suprelorin years ago.\nActually, that anxiety, together with the timing of when you're seeing the bloody discharge, gives me another idea for how you can move forward (though Saw Palmetto is a great thing to introduce, so keep on with your plan to do that). \nIn Chinese medicine, the winter solstice is when 'internal Stasis' conditions can become aggravated. Additionally, it's a time of year when diapedesis (passive leaking of blood out of the vessels) is more likely to happen. The other time of year when I would expect that to occur would be in April or May. \nThe treatment for that is Lift the Qi Combination, from Kan Essentials. From a biomedical perspective, it is an immune stimulant, so if there is some infectious component to this, it will address it. \nI would pair the product with two other Kan Essentials products, which we have used successfully to combat BPH (and even prostatic adenocarcinoma). They are Dispel Stasis in the Middle Palace, and Dispel Stasis in the Lower Palace. Those products combat the tendency to Stasis that I mentioned.\nI would be surprised if you didn't resolve this problem using those three together. You can just use the label dose on the bottle, since you're giving three things at a time. If it didn't work quite well enough, try a higher dose.

        "answer": "Brenda McNeill, the main issue with epilepsy is if the seizures are protracted or happening too close together (i.e., clustering) in which case an animal can't breathe and may suffer brain damage.\nIf that doesn't really describe your dog's seizure, then as a general rule, drugs for seizures should be seriously considered if the seizures are happening every month or even more often.\nIf that doesn't describe your dog either, then I would implement herbal medicine instead, to see if you can prevent the next event, since these herbs have lots of other beneficial effects on liver, kidney and heart function, as well as cognition and blood pressure. The two formulas I recommend to use together as sort of a 'knee jerk' prescription are Halscion (https://goldstandardherbs.com/products/Original-Halscion-85g-p647327436) from Gold Standard Herbs, and Calm Repose from Kan Essentials. You could even just try half doses of Halscion (but full doses of Calm Repose) if your dog's seizures are only happening annually, or even less often. If your vet doesn't carry Kan products, you can source them through Aleksandra Topic using the instructions she provides here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158575954706282/posts/1420037418560133/?paipv=0&eav=AfZGj2odyETDL5zXKRY2yR0spVwm7K8LjggA1yzzVXhXl_jcc7Ej0fU8YTR_8vcj8yA&_rdr\nHopefully this helps you out!"
